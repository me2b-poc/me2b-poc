# Outline of Proposal

This takes some of the text from the docx and helps us build a proposal.

## Stages of this project include:

### Clarifying requirements
- The proposal will include a complete set of candidate
requirements along with a PoC.

### Defining the Ontology structure
  - link to existing ontology work
  - take ontology from https://zdrive.li/LnH

### Building & Populating the software platform

### Ongoing support of the software platform.

### Ongoing support of the wiki

It is not reasonable to expect the wiki to be managed fully and
completely by the community.  The community should be tapped to
the greatest extent possible, however, spontaneous and complete
support is not in the nature of this sort of endeavour.  On the
other hand....

what happens is that effort transitions from authorial to
editorial to curatorial over time, specifically as the system
maintains and increases in value.
