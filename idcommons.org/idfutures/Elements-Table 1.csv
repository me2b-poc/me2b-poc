STORK 2.0,Research Project,,"Secure idenTity acrOss boRders linKed 2.0 will contribute to the realization of a single European electronic identification and authentication area. It builds on the results of STORK, establishing interoperability of different approaches at national and EU level, eID for persons, eID for legal entities.

STORK 2.0 will be a step forward towards the creation of a fully operational framework and infrastructure for electronic identities and authentication in the EU. It does so through:
* Exploiting experiences from four cross border, cross sector pilots with real impact demonstrating the use and societal impact of the cross border, cross sector infrastructure developed;
* Common specifications and building blocks for interoperable legal identities and mandates, on top of the interoperability infrastructure developed in STORK, following privacy rules (and advice from Art.29 Working Party) and enabling secure operation;
* Solving within the scope of the pilots legal issues such as privacy/data protection, liability, different National regimes,
* An update of the QAA model to include attributes, legal entities and mandate agreements;
* eID packaged as a service for governments and businesses including a cost model and promoting the business take-up of STORK;
* Addressing eID governance issues through the requirements for an accreditation body
* Investigating and promoting standardization in the area of eID using STORK 2.0 solutions
* A knowledge repository and awareness of the STORK 2.0 infrastructure and its potential societal impact on business processes.

STORK 2.0 Pilots, focused on strategic eLearning and Academic Qualifications, eBanking, Public Services for Business and eHealth areas, will demonstrate interoperable services that e-ID can offer in real-life settings and validate common specifications, standards and building blocks, convincingly addressing challenging legal and governance issues (across borders, application domains and different sectors). These applications will test the ease towards borderless digital living and mobility in the EU, enhancing the Digital Single Market for public and commercial services in alignment with the Services Directive. As a result of our vision of e-ID as a Service Offering, STORK 2.0 methodology seeks to maximize take-up of its scalable solutions by European public and private sectors, with a strong commitment to open specifications and long-term sustainability (backed by participating European industry). STORK 2.0 will be a key-enabler to support the open, competitive digital economy envisaged in the Europe 2020 Strategy and is aligned with Key Actions in the Digital Agenda, thus contributing to Europe’s leadership role of the eID market. Strong liaisons are being established with other LSPs (epSOS, PEPPOL, SPOCS, e-CODEX and e-SENS), the thematic network SSEDIC, as well as ISA’s STORK Sustainability action, closely following and relating to other international efforts in eID.

The STORK 2.0 consortium comprises 19 EU MS / Associated Countries driving the Pilot and building a common, comprehensive and long-term vision of eID in Europe. Private and public organizations are involved in the management, technical infrastructure and dissemination of the pilots. It includes 13 countries with previous STORK interoperability infrastructure and pioneering services and 6 new countries joining the new technical infrastructure. Different types of organizations (industry, academia, government) of different levels (local, regional, national) covering the entire eID delivery chain of value will be included in pilot activities, from public and private identity & attribute providers and organizations responsible for common infrastructure components in each MS to providers in real-life settings of content and services for STORK 2.0 end-users (both natural & legal persons). This ensures pilots serve real needs, beyond the lifetime of STORK 2.0.

The consortium has been formed in an open way, maximizing the possibilities for many to collaborate. Furthermore, the consortium regularly informs the public and relevant stakeholders on the progress made, asks for input and aligns strategies. STORK 2.0 offers the opportunity to other European countries, industry, standardization bodies and other ICT-PSP projects to play an important role in benefitting from and enriching the results of the project through knowledge sharing via a number of open workshops, focus groups and dissemination channels. Non-European countries representatives are invited as well to join the project as project external advisors. This also creates a base for future take-up up beyond the current partnership. All results (i.e. specifications of interfaces, protocols, architecture, open source reference implementations of necessary components and building blocks for interoperability) will be freely available after the end of the pilot online, and partners of the consortium are committed.",,,,,,https://www.eid-stork.eu,
e-Government Core Vocabularies,Working Group,,"The e-Government Core Vocabularies are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity, such as a person, a business, a location or a public service, in a context-neutral way.

Core Vocabularies are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Public administrations can use and extend the Core Vocabularies in the following contexts:

Development of new systems: the Core Vocabularies can be used as a default starting point for designing the conceptual and logical data models in newly developed information systems.

Information exchange between systems: the Core Vocabularies can become the basis of a context-specific data model used to exchange data among existing information systems.

Data integration: the Core Vocabularies can be used to integrate data that comes from disparate data sources and create a data mesh-up.

Open data publishing: the Core Vocabularies can be used as the foundation of a common export format for data in base registries like cadastres, business registers and public service portals.

T2TRG Thing-to-Thing Research Group,Research Project,,"The Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG) will investigate open research issues in turning a true “Internet of Things” into reality, an Internet where low-resource nodes (“things”, “constrained nodes”) can communicate among themselves and with the wider Internet, in order to partake in permissionless innovation. The focus of the T2TRG are on issues that touch opportunities for standardization in the IETF, i.e., it will start at the adaptation layer connecting devices to IP, and end at the application layer with architectures and APIs for communicating and making data and management functions (including security functions) available.

### Motivation
A first wave of IoT standards has been completed by the IETF. Consortia are now forming to build infrastructure and industry agreements around those. This generates new requirements for research, based on actual usage of the standards now available.

In parallel, W3C has set up an IG (Interest Group) on the Web of Things (WoT); this is operating on a similar timeline as an RG does in the IRTF. A parallel activity associated with the IETF/IRTF can help ensure the common work does not stop at the traditional boundaries of the W3C, but considers networking issues as well. IETF WGs are also active on these topics, but an IRTF RG can provide a more long-term perspective to the collaboration.

### Areas of Interest
A number of areas of interest have been identified:
* Understanding the motivation for single-purpose silos and gateways; facilitating a move towards small pieces loosely joined (hence “thing-to-thing”); enabling scaling the number of applications in a single network
* Deployment considerations; scaling considerations; cost of ownership
* Management and operation of “things”
* Lifecycle aspects (including, but not limited to, security considerations)
* Cooperation with W3C, e.g., on data models, formats, and semantics

More exploratory areas of interest include:
* Operating “things” that have multiple masters/stakeholders (including understanding role definitions of devices, owners, operators, etc.)
* Exploring the duality of state- and event-based approaches
* Aspects of distribution (cf. “fog computing”); reliability and scalability considerations
* Containerization and other forms of mobile code",,,,,,https://irtf.org/t2trg,

Non-paper on the IT Governance of CEF Building Block Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs),Publication,,"This non-paper paper is the result of a fruitful collaboration between the Commission and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Expert Group. The text of the non-paper reflects the comments received at the CEF Telecom Expert Group Meeting of 24 October 2014 on the draft proposal elaborated by DG CNECT and DIGIT with the support of the various Commission services involved in the CEF.
This non-paper is organised into two chapters:

*  The first chapter: 'Introduction', clarifies the purpose (Section 1.1), application (Section 1.2) and scope (Section 1.3) of the proposed IT Governance Model;
* · The second chapter: 'Proposed IT Governance Model', describes what an IT Governance Model is (Section 2.1) and its objectives (Section 2.2). Two sections constitute the core of the non- paper, the principles of governance that underpin the IT Governance Model (Section 2.3) and the model itself (Section 2.4). Finally, this chapter looks at the governance bodies that are proposed to embody the model (Section 2.5) and how they interact with each other (Section 2.6).

The proposed IT Governance Model will be implemented once it is agreed with the CEF Expert Group and the CEF Coordination Committee.

In the first months of CEF, EU Member States and associated countries1 (both hereafter referred to under the term 'Member States') raised concerns2 about the IT governance of CEF Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs) and, in particular, about the governance of the CEF building block DSIs3 as these are going to be reused by several sector-specific DSIs and by projects in policy domains not directly funded by CEF. The Commission shares the concerns of Member States and agrees that the roll-out and take-up of the CEF building block DSIs in different policy domains cannot be based on 'self-organisation' where every DSI works independently of one another. This is why the Commission is putting forward, by means of this draft non-paper, a proposal for an 'integrated' IT Governance Model. The proposed model has been designed according to guiding principles stemming from Regulation 1316/2013 establishing the Connecting Europe Facility (hereafter referred to as 'the CEF Regulation') and Regulation 283/2014 guidelines for trans-European networks in the area of telecommunications infrastructure (hereafter referred to as 'the Guidelines'). The proposed model was also influenced by the work currently being developed in the Electronic Simple European Networked Services (e-SENS) Large Scale Pilot. Once agreed and implemented, the IT Governance Model will promote coherence across CEF building block DSIs and trust between them and the sector-specific DSIs while promoting efficiency and avoiding the duplication of structures. The DSIs are expected to contribute to a fully functioning Digital Single Market for online and communications services in Europe, a priority of the new Commission4 and of the new legislative period for the European Union.",,,,,,https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/28012015%20CEF%20Telecom%20EG%20Non-Paper%20on%20IT%20Governance%20of%20CEF%20BB%20DSIs%20-%20REVISED%20-%20v5.01.pdf,

ITU-T Study Group 17 (SG17) coordinates security-related work across all ITU-T Study Groups. Often working in cooperation with other standards development organizations (SDOs) and various ICT industry consortia, SG17 deals with a broad range of standardization issues.

To give a few examples, SG17 is currently working on cybersecurity; security management; security architectures and frameworks; countering spam; identity management; the protection of personally identifiable information; and the security of applications and services for the Internet of Things (IoT), smart grid, smartphones, web services, social networks, cloud computing, mobile financial systems, IPTV and telebiometrics.

One key reference for security standards in use today is Recommendation ITU-T X.509 for electronic authentication over public networks. ITU-T X.509, a cornerstone in designing applications relating to public key infrastructure (PKI), is used in a wide range of applications; from securing the connection between a browser and a server on the web, to providing digital signatures that enable e-commerce transactions to be conducted with the same confidence as in a traditional system. Without wide acceptance of the standard, the rise of e-business would have been impossible.

Lawtrust,Company,,"https://www.lawtrust.co.zaThe people at LAWtrust are passionate about information security, which addresses business’ need to create trust between stakeholders. LAWtrust understands that trust in business dealings is established through accountability and privacy, which in turn require the establishment of positive identity through verifiable signatures and confidentiality of information. LAWtrust’s solutions are mapped against these business needs so that it can deliver real business value. LAWtrust has a clear vision for trusted identities and securing transaction through its well established Certificate Authority and security integration capacity and capabilities. Focused on meeting globally recognised industry standards to deliver and support its solutions, LAWtrust has in-depth experience and have achieved the following:
• First Certificate Authority to be accredited for Advanced Electronic Signatures by the Department of Communications under the ECT Act of 2002. This is the South African equivalent of a EU Qualified Signature.
• Certificate Authority included in both the Adobe and the Microsoft Approved Trust Lists as a Trusted Certificate Authority
• WebTrust certification and ISO21188 compliant PKI for financial services
• Provider of the South African National ID PKI, encryption and biometric fraud management systems
The key LAWtrust differentiator in this specialist market is its rapid integration middleware called the Trust Service Orchestrator (TSO). This allows organisations to deploy a hybrid model of on-premise and Trust Centre hosted functions which is all accessed through an on-premise service catalog. The TSO handles all the security functions back to the Trust Centre and applies the correct business logic where necessary. An example of this service in action is the LAWtrust Biometric Matching Service which is deployed in banking and government customers. The Biometric Matching service is access through the TSO by any channel (branch, internet etc) and can centrally match the multi modal biometrics through a variety of best of breed vendor algorithms for fingerprint, face, iris and voice matching. The result of the authentication can then be used to unlock a digital certificate/private key hosted on a secure signing service and apply a long term, time stamped digital signature to a document or transaction. Lawtrust also provides a biometric digital signature and evidence system known as eDNA (electronic DNA). This system is the most widely deployed government fraud management system and and ensures that employees are accountable for high risk transactions through a mechanism of biometrically unlocked digital signature after which the system retains all evidence in a time stamped and encrypted vault.
Apart from these major systems, LAWtrust provides the following products and services:
• SSL certificates
• PKI (on premise or cloud)
• Multi factor Strong Authentication
• Encryption libraries
• PKI applets
• Mobile biometrics solutions
• Consulting and training

European Data Protection Supervisor (Contrôleur européen de la protection des données),Part of Supra-National Government,,"The EDPS' general objective is to ensure that the European institutions and bodies respect the right to privacy when they process personal data and develop new policies. A number of specific duties of the EDPS are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001. The three main fields of work are: 
* Supervision : the EDPS monitors the processing of personal data in the EU administration and ensures compliance with the data protection rules. The supervisory tasks  range from prior checking processing operations likely to present specific risks, to handling complaints and conducting enquiries.
* Consultation : the EDPS advises the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on proposals for new legislation and a wide range of other issues having an impact on data protection.
* Cooperation : the EDPS cooperates with other data protection authorities in order to promote consistent data protection throughout Europe. The central platform for cooperation with national data protection authorities is the Article 29 Working Party.

The third leg of EDPS' activities can best be described as cooperation. It covers work on specific issues, such as the interpretation of the EU Data Protection Directive, as well as more structural collaboration together with other data protection authorities. The overriding aim of the EDPS is to promote consistency in the protection of personal data throughout the EU.
 
The central forum for cooperation in the EU is the Article 29 Working Party . This is where the national data protection authorities meet to exchange views on current issues, to discuss a common interpretation of data protection legislation and to give expert advice to the European Commission.  

The EDPS also participates in the work to ensure good data protection in the EU's third pillar, which covers police and judicial cooperation (formerly ""EU's third pillar""). This includes attending a number of meetings of the Joint Supervisory Bodies with deal with information systems in the area of police and justice. He is also a member of the Working Party on Police and Justice set up by the European Conference to provide advice in the area of law enforcement.

One of the most important cooperative tasks relates to the large scale IT system Eurodac , where the responsibilities for data protection supervision are shared. The system consists of national units (subject to national law), and a central unit (subject to the EU Data Protection Regulation). It therefore requires a coordinated approach that is developed through biannual coordination meetings organised by the EDPS.",,,,,,https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS,

Web Payment Activity,Discussion Group,,"Payment is an essential element of trade and commerce, and ""digital interactions are expected to influence 64 cents of every dollar spent in retail stores by the end of 2015. However, behind these impressive numbers, the payment landscape is quickly changing, and new challenges are appearing. For instance, the average shopping cart abandonment rate is 69% across all devices, and even higher on mobile. A variety of factors are limiting the potential of ecommerce, from the high level fraud related to credit card payments, to the fragmentation of payment solutions available on the Web but not available on all merchant sites or on all devices.
At the same time, there is a growing interest from businesses to find alternatives to business models based on advertisement. These alternatives include e.g. in-app payments, or micropayments that are today challenging due to a variety of factors such as heterogeneity and number of payment options to support, or the inability for existing payment systems to cope with very small payments.
In order to address these issues, and for greater interoperability in the area of payments, the vision behind this activity is to enable: 1) Users to choose their preferred payment solutions across all their devices; 2) Merchants to transparently support a growing number of payment solutions; 3) Developers to monetize applications more easily; 4) New payment solution providers to enter the market more easily with innovative solutions and payment schemes; 5) Society to decrease online fraud; 6) New payment models such as micropayments & paywalls to take-off.",,,,,,http://www.w3.org/Payments/,

ACE - Authentication and Authorization of Constrained Environments,Working Group,,"The IETF has recently developed protocols for use in constrained
environments, where network nodes are limited in CPU, memory and power. 
REST architecture is widely used for such constrained environments.
It has been observed that Internet protocols can be applied to these
constrained environments, often only requiring minor tweaking and
profiling. In other cases, new protocols have been defined to address
the specific requirements of constrained environments. An example of
such a protocol is the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).

As in other environments, authentication and authorization questions
also arise in constrained environments. For example, a door lock has to
authorize the person seeking access using a ""digital key"". Where is the
authorization policy stored? How does the digital key communicate with
the lock? Does the lock interact with an authorization server to obtain
authorization information? How can access be temporarily granted to
other persons? How can access be revoked? These types of questions have
been answered by existing protocols for use cases outside constrained
environments, however in constrained environments, additional and
different requirements pose challenges for the use of various security
protocols. In particular, the need arises for a dynamic and fine grained
access control mechanism, where clients and/or resource servers are
constrained.

The IETF has a long history in developing three-party authentication and
authorization protocols for distributed environments. Examples include
Kerberos, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the Authentication,
Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure, and the Web
Authorization Protocol (OAuth). All these protocols enjoy widespread
deployment on the Internet. Although they all aim to solve a similar
goal, at an abstract level, they offer quite different functions and
utilize different message exchanges. These differences result from the
main deployment use cases they were designed for respectively.

Requirements derived from use cases may indicate that existing work is
useful as basis for a solution for constrained environments. These 
protocols, however, were not optimized for constrained environments. 
Additional requirements that need to be taken into account are the lack 
of a suitable user-interface and the inability of embedded devices to 
contact an authorization server in real-time with every resource access 
request due to intermittent connectivity, etc.

This working group therefore aims to produce a standardized solution for
authentication and authorization to enable authorized access (Get, Put,
Post, Delete) to resources identified by a URI and hosted on a resource
server in constrained environments. As a starting point, the working
group will assume that access to resources at a resource server by a
client device takes place using CoAP and is protected by DTLS. Both
resource server and client may be constrained. This access will be
mediated by an authorization server, which is not considered to be
constrained.

Existing authentication and authorization protocols will be evaluated 
and used where applicable to build the constrained-environment solution. 
This requires relevant specifications to be reviewed for suitability, 
selecting a subset of them and restricting the options within each of 
the specifications. Some functionality, however, may not be available in
existing protocols, in which case the solution may also involve new
protocol work. Leveraging existing work means the working group benefits
from available security analysis, implementation, and deployment
experience. Moreover, a standardized solution for federated
authentication and authorization will help to stimulate the deployment
of constrained devices that provide increased security.

Once progress in identifying suitable candidate solutions has been made,
the working group will verify whether the same mechanisms are also
applicable beyond the use of CoAP and DTLS, which are the two main
protocols the group will focus on for access to resources. In 
particular, the ability to use the developed solution over HTTP and TLS
will be investigated. Note that the initial focus is on CoAP and HTTP 
with DTLS and TLS. Other security protocols may be considered as long as 
the primary focus is maintained. The group is scoped to work only on the 
web protocols and data carried within them. Furthermore, to guarantee 
smooth transition, the integration with existing deployments will be 
studied, particularly concerning the use of protocol translation 
proxies.

This work does not make the assumption that the party offering
application layer services is always the same party offering network
access services. ACE will need to interact with CORE and LWIG to
ensure coordination.

The working group has the following tasks:

1) Produce use cases and requirements

2) Identify authentication and authorization mechanisms suitable for
resource access in constrained environments.",,,,,,,

The Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications, known as the ePrivacy Directive, sets out rules on how providers of electronic communication services, such as telecoms companies and Internet Service Providers, should manage their subscribers' data. It also guarantees rights for subscribers when they use these services. These are the main requirements imposed by the Directive:

1) Confidentiality of communications: EU Member States must ensure the confidentiality of communications over public networks, in particular by prohibiting the listening into, tapping and storage of communications without the consent of the users concerned.
2) Security of networks and services: a provider of a public electronic communications service has to take appropriate measures to safeguard the security of its service.
3) Data breach notifications: if a provider suffers a breach of security that leads to personal data being lost or stolen, it has to inform the national authority and, in certain cases, the subscriber or individual.
4) Traffic and location data: this data must be erased or made anonymous when no longer required for communication or billing purposes, except if the subscriber has given consent for another use.
5) Spam: subscribers must give their prior consent before unsolicited commercial communications (""spam"") are addressed to them. This also covers SMS text messages and other electronic messages received on any fixed or mobile terminal.
6) Public directories: subscribers' prior consent is required in order for their telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and postal addresses to appear in public directories.
7) Calling-line identification: subscribers must be given the option not to have their telephone number disclosed when they make a call.",,,,,,https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eprivacy-directive,
FIDO Alliance,Organization / Trade Association,,"The FIDO protocols use standard public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication. During registration with an online service, the user’s client device creates a new key pair. It retains the private key and registers the public key with the online service. Authentication is done by the client device proving possession of the private key to the service by signing a challenge. The client’s private keys can be used only after they are unlocked locally on the device by the user. The local unlock is accomplished by a user–friendly and secure action such as swiping a finger, entering a PIN, speaking into a microphone, inserting a second–factor device or pressing a button.

The FIDO protocols are designed from the ground up to protect user privacy. The protocols do not provide information that can be used by different online services to collaborate and track a user across the services. Biometric information, if used, never leaves the user’s device.",,,,,2016-09-22,https://fidoalliance.org/,

Many wearable devices include a camera of some form. Though a camera would only capture some of the above elements, the camera feature is the focus of many current privacy concerns.3 It is the ability of these devices to record, perhaps constantly, and perhaps covertly, that leads to many con- cerns, particularly with respect to the privacy of non-users who may be the subject of those record- ings.",,,,,,https://datenschutz-berlin.de/attachments/1155/675.50.15.pdf?1448447156,

Future of Identity in the Information Society (FIDIS),Research Project,Europe|over,"The European Information Society (EIS) requires technologies which address trust and security yet also preserve the privacy of individuals. As the EIS develops, the increasingly digital representation of personal characteristics changes our ways of identifying individuals, and supplementary digital identities, so-called virtual identities, embodying concepts such as pseudonymity and anonymity, are being created for security, profit, convenience or even for fun. These new identities are feeding back into the world of social and business affairs, offering a mix of plural identities and challenging traditional notions of identity. At the same time, European states manage identities in very different ways. For example, in Germany holding an ID card is mandatory for every adult, while in the UK state-issued ID cards do not exist. FIDIS objectives are shaping the requirements for the future management of identity in the EIS and contributing to the technologies and infrastructures needed.

As a multidisciplinary and multinational NoE FIDIS, appropriately, comprises different country research experiences with heterogeneous focuses, and integrates European expertise around a common set of activities. Additionally, all relevant stakeholders are addressed to ensure that the requirements are considered from different levels. FIDIS overcomes the extreme fragmentation of research into the future of identity by consolidating and fostering joint research in this area. Research results will be made accessible to European citizens, researchers and in particular to SMEs. FIDIS will accomplish ERA objectives by durably integrating the research implementation efforts, as well as the medium term target setting, and in the long run the strategic objective planning.

Our Objectives:
Integrating European research with regard to Technologies to:
* Support identity and identification
* Interoperability of identity and identification concepts
* ID-theft, privacy and security
 *Profiling and forensic implications

Our Results:
* Integrated approaches to research
* Legal, socio-economic, usability and application requirements.

Working Paper on Privacy and Electronic Micropayment on the Internet,Publication,,"Public policy statements by prominent media organisations have signalled that the era of free online media may be nearing its end. Accordingly, several providers of online services, and specifically online newspapers, around the globe are beginning to offer access to their services exclusively on a fee paying basis.
The business models discussed range from subscription services where access would be offered for a monthly fee to „pay per view“ business models where a small amount of money is paid for access to a single informa- tion item (so-called “micropayment”, e. g. for an online newspaper article or video clip).
In addition, the latest generation of mobile devices provide the opportunity to install access capability to online media service via so-called „Apps“. Several providers of mobile devices have started to offer their own distribu- tion platforms for such „Apps“, including related payment services.
At the same time, so-called „Third-Party Applications“ are becoming increasingly popular in social network services,. Many of these „Third-Party Applications“ are being offered for a fee by a different service provider from the provider of the social network. Facebook, for example, has recently announced the introduction of its own currency „facebook coins“ for paying for services inside its social network.
These developments can lead to infringements of the privacy of users of such services, if the basic principles for the protection of privacy are not being taken into account. Indeed, the providers of such micropayment systems have the opportunity to generate advertising revenue by exploiting the detailed personal transactional information that they may capture.
  Previously, the Working Group has frequently stressed the need for the preservation of anonymity to the larg- 1
est extent possible as an essential aspect of privacy protection on the Internet . More specifically, the Working
Group has underlined the need to maintain the possibility of anonymous access to digital media, and in par- 2
ticular digital television . More recently, these principles have been reconfirmed in the concept of „privacy by 3

Personal Identity Verification,Specification,,"In response to HSPD 12, the NIST Computer Security Division initiated a new program for improving the identification and authentication of Federal employees and contractors for access to Federal facilities and information systems. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, entitled Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to satisfy the requirements of HSPD 12, approved by the Secretary of Commerce, and issued on February 25, 2005.

FIPS 201 incorporates three technical publications specifying several aspects of the required administrative procedures and technical specifications that may change as the standard is implemented and used. NIST Special Publication 800-73, ""Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification"" specifies the interface and data elements of the PIV card; NIST Special Publication 800-76, Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification"" specifies the technical acquisition and formatting requirements for biometric data of the PIV system; and NIST Special Publication 800-78, ""Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification"" specifies the acceptable cryptographic algorithms and key sizes to be implemented and used for the PIV system.

In addition, a number of guidelines, reference implementations, and conformance tests has been developed to: implement and use the PIV system; protect the personal privacy of all subscribers of the PIV system; create a PIV ""card"" that is ""personalized"" with data needed by the PIV system to later grant access to the subscriber to Federal facilities and information systems; assure appropriate levels of security for all applicable Federal applications; and provide interoperability among Federal organizations using the standards.

The release of FIPS 201 marked the beginning of a learn-design-develop-test-validate phase for both the private sector and federal departments and agencies. By 2009, more than 300 standard-conformant products had been developed, validated, and brought to market in support of the PIV card and its infrastructure. Departments and agencies also developed and refined their PIV card issuance processes. PIV card issuance systems are have been operating, and close to 5 million PIV cards have been issued to federal employees and contractors, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Today, the emphasis has shifted from PIV card issuance to its deployment and use in logical and physical access applications.",,,,,,http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/,

Working Paper on privacy risks in the re-use of email accounts and similar information society services,Publication,,"For many people, email has become the primary means of communication, superseding traditional mail for both domestic and business purposes. An email account which can identify an individual and can be used for personal communications is universally regarded by data protection and privacy authorities as constituting personal data.
An individual may have one or many email accounts, which may have been provided via a free or a paid-for service; an employee may also be permitted by his employer to use a business email ad- dress for personal purposes. Apparently “free” email accounts may be packaged in with information services such as broadband services and cable TV.
So what happens if an individual needs to change his email service provider?
The real-world analogy is with moving house. Normally, when someone moves house, they send out letters to all their business and personal contacts informing them of the new address. In addition, the person will normally arrange with the postal services for all of their mail to be redirected to their new address – not a simple matter as nowadays there may be many postal delivery services involved. The ‘backstop’ is to give the new occupants re-address labels to use for any residual mail that ar- rives.
If we translate this real-world analogy into cyberspace then we need to consider any information so- ciety service that involves identifying an individual by name. This can include the increasingly popu- lar social networking services and cyber-trading accounts which use an email address for validation purposes and to which electronically delivered goods and invoices, etc. may be sent. The problem may also manifest itself in the case of SMS messaging associated with mobile phones.",,,,,,https://datenschutz-berlin.de/attachments/661/society_services.pdf?1278642489,

MAPRG Measurement and Analysis for Protocols Research Group,Research Project,,"Our Internet has grown into something that differs from what was envisioned. Its protocols sometimes operate in an environment other than than that for which they were designed. For instance, some network elements treat some protocols differently than others and those protocols themselves are sometimes reused and abused in ways initially unforeseen. The Measurement and Analysis for Protocols Research Group (MAP) Research Group (RG) explores such phenomena by measurement with the aim to inform protocol engineering and practice.

Many protocol engineering efforts in a standards development context, as well as best practices for the operation of IETF-defined protocols, can benefit from insight provided by Internet measurements of various kinds. Likewise, Internet measurement research efforts can stand to gain from contacts with the IETF. The Measurement and Analysis for Protocols Research Group Research Group (MAPRG) aims to provide a forum for interchange between these two communities, supporting:
* exchange of measurement-derived insight;
* discussion of techniques and best practices for measurement relevant to protocol engineering and network operations;
* collaborations to share data supporting these measurements; and
* a “landing pad” for the Internet measurement community to introduce its efforts to the IETF.",,,,,2016-08-22,https://irtf.org/maprg,
International Identity Law and Policy Workshop,Event,,"Attendees were lawyers, business leaders, policy experts, and technologists representing a broad spectrum of public sector, private sector, and NGO leaders in identity. Participants also included experts involved in drafting the recently-enacted identity legislation in the EU and Virginia, and experts currently involved in planned and proposed upcoming legislative initiatives relating to identity management in both the U.S. and internationally.
The impetus for the meeting was several recent developments relating to identity management legislation. They included the following recently adopted identity management legislation:
• The European Union eIDAS Regulation adopted in 2014, and
• The Virginia Electronic Identity Management Act adopted in 2015;
and the following planned or proposed projects to develop new identity management legislation:
• The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (International) project to develop international rules providing “a basic legal framework covering identity management transactions;”
• The Uniform Law Commission (United States) proposal to develop uniform identity management legislation for the 50 U.S. states; and
• The Virginia Identity Management Standards Advisory Council (Virginia) project to advise the Virginia Secretary of Technology on the identity management standards to be adopted as regulations in Virginia under its new Identity Management Act.

The goal of the meeting was to discuss the direction that such new identity management legislation should take, the issues it should address, and desired approaches.
A key theme reiterated throughout the event was the importance of focusing on outcome-based legislation. Participants voiced concern that legislation prescribing a specific technical process to implement identity standards would hinder innovation and ultimately prevent the success of a new legal regime.
This Report summarizes at a high-level the robust, thought-provoking and productive discussion in which the participants engaged.",,,,,,http://openidentityexchange.org/2016/01/international-identity-law-policy-workshop/,

In particular, the NMRG will work on solutions for problems that are not yet considered well understood enough for engineering work within the IETF.

The initial focus of the NMRG will be on higher-layer management services that interface with the current Internet management framework. This includes communication services between management systems, which may belong to different management domains, as well as customer-oriented management services. The NMRG is expected to identify and document requirements, to survey possible approaches, to provide specifications for proposed solutions, and to prove concepts with prototype implementations that can be tested in large-scale real-world environments.

The IETF Operations and Management Area Directors are members of the NMRG mailing list and invited to NMRG meetings in order to ensure free flow of information in both directions, and to avoid duplication of work with the various IETF working groups.

Future Trust,Research Project,Europe,"Against the background of the regulation 2014/910/EU on electronic identification (eID) and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS), the FutureTrust project, which is funded within the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020) under Grant Agreement No. 700542, aims at supporting the practical implementation of the regulation in Europe and beyond.

For this purpose the FutureTrust project will address the need for globally interoperable solutions through basic research with respect to the foundations of trust and trustworthiness, actively support the standardisation process in relevant areas, and provide Open Source software components and trustworthy services which will ease the use of eID and electronic signature technology in real world applications. In particular the FutureTrust project will extend the existing European Trust Service Status List (TSL) infrastructure towards a “Global Trust List”, develop a comprehensive Open Source Validation Service as well as a scalable Preservation Service for electronic signatures and seals and will provide components for the eID-based application for qualified certificates across borders, and for the trustworthy creation of remote signatures and seals in a mobile environment.

ABC4Trust,Project Pilot/Proof of Concept,Europe|over,"The goal of ABC4Trust is to address the federation and interchangeability of technologies that support trustworthy yet privacy-preserving Attribute-based Credentials (ABC). So far, credentials such as digitally signed pieces of personal information or other information used to authenticate or identify a user were not designed to respect the users privacy. They inevitably reveal the identity of the holder even though the application at hand often needs much less information, for instance only the confirmation that the holder is a teenager or is eligible for social benefits. In contrast to that, Attribute-based Credentials allow a holder to reveal just the minimal information required by the application, without giving away full identity information. These credentials thus facilitate the implementation of a trustworthy and at the same time privacy-protecting digital society.

The objectives of ABC4Trust are:
* Defining a common, unified architecture for ABC systems to allow comparing their respective features and combining them on common platforms
* Delivering open reference implementations of selected ABC systems and deploy them in actual production pilots allowing provably accredited members of restricted communities to provide anonymous feedback on their community or its members.",,,,,,https://abc4trust.eu,

Internet Research Task Force IRTF,Working Group,,"Distributing and manipulating named information is a major application in the Internet today. In addition to web-based content distribution, other distribution technologies (such as P2P and CDN) have emerged and are promoting a communication model of accessing data by name, regardless of origin server location.

In order to respond to increasing traffic volume in the current Internet for applications such as mobile video and cloud computing, a set of disparate technologies and distribution services are employed that employ caching, replication and content distribution in different specific ways. These approaches are currently deployed in separate silos – different CDN providers and P2P applications rely on proprietary distribution technologies. It is not possible to uniquely and securely identify named information independently of the distribution channel; and the different distribution approaches are typically implemented as an overlay, leading to unnecessary inefficiency.

Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to directly support this use by introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle. Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. These concepts are known under different terms, including but not limited to: Network of Information (NetInf), Named Data Networking (NDN) and Publish/Subscribe Networking.

ICN concepts can be applied to different layers of the protocol stack: name-based data access can be implemented on top of the existing IP infrastructure, e.g., by providing resource naming, ubiquitous caching and corresponding transport services, or it can be seen as a packet-level internetworking technology that would cause fundamental changes to Internet routing and forwarding. In summary, ICN is expected to evolve the Internet architecture at different layers.",,,,,2012-04-17,https://irtf.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Task_Force

Working Paper Privacy by Design and Smart Metering: Minimize Personal Information to Maintain Privacy,Publication,,"With the ongoing growth of the Smart Grid, the role of the utility is changing. Historically, energy providers focused on maintaining consistent supply at the lowest possible cost; interactions with cus- tomers largely involved billing and minimizing credit risk. However, with the current redesign of elec- trical systems, these interactions are being radically redesigned, as smart meters allow utilities to gain information about the usage patterns of their residential customers at a level of detail that was previously unavailable, and in near real-time. This change is allowing for the development of an ar- ray of new services and efficiencies for both the consumer and the utility.
To maintain consumer trust and confidence, the Smart Grid and smart metering will necessitate the emergence of a new relationship between utilities and individuals, centred on customer engagement. Privacy and data security will be the dual cornerstones of this relationship.",,,,,,https://datenschutz-berlin.de/attachments/842/675.43.18_WP_Privacy_and_Smart_Metering.pdf?1321458912,

STORK,Research Project,Europe,"The aim of the STORK project is to establish a European eID Interoperability Platform that will allow citizens to establish new e-relations across borders, just by presenting their national eID.

Cross-border user authentication for such e-relations will be applied and tested by the project by means of five pilot projects that will use existing government services in EU Member States. In time however, additional service providers will also become connected to the platform thereby increasing the number of cross-border services available to European users. 

Thus in the future, you should be able to start a company, get your tax refund, or obtain your university papers without physical presence; all you will need to access these services is to enter your personal data using your national eID, and the STORK platform will obtain the required guarantee (authentication) from your government.

User-centric Approach = Privacy Guarantee

The role of the STORK platform is to identify a user who is in a session with a service provider, and to send his data to this service. Whilst the service provider may request various data items, the user always controls the data to be sent. The explicit consent of the owner of the data, the user, is always required before his data can be sent to the service provider.

The platform will not store any personal data, so no data can be lost.

This user centric approach was not taken to satisfy some philosophical preferences, but in line with the legislative requirements of all the various countries involved that oblige concrete measures to be taken to guarantee that a citizen's fundamental rights, such as his privacy, are respected.",,,,,,https://www.eid-stork.eu,

Working Paper on Big Data and Privacy Privacy principles under pressure in the age of Big Data analytics,Publication,,"BigData is a term which refers to the enormous increase in access to and automated use of information.2 It refers to the gigantic amounts of digital data controlled by companies, authorities and other large organisations which are subjected to extensive analysis based on the use of algorithms.

Big Data entails a challenge to key privacy principles. Some claim that it will be 
impossible to enforce these principles in an age characterised by Big Data.4 According to this view, the protection of privacy must primarily be safeguarded through enterprises providing clear and comprehensive information on how personal data is handled. The Working Group is of the opinion, however, that the protection of privacy is more important than ever at a time when increasing amounts of information are collected about individuals.5 The privacy principles constitute our guarantee that we will not be subjected to extensive profiling in an ever increasing array of new contexts. A watering down of key privacy principles, in combination with more extensive use of Big Data, may have adverse consequences for the protection of privacy and other important values in society such as freedom of expression and the conditions for exchange of ideas.

3. Some core principles have been stipulated by the OECD and in the European Data Protection Directive for how personal data may be processed in a reasonable, correct and legitimate manner.6 The following principles in particular are of relevance for Big Data: purpose limitation, relevance and data minimisation, completeness and quality, transparency and right of access to information.",,,,,,https://datenschutz-berlin.de/attachments/1052/WP_Big_Data_final_clean_675.48.12.pdf?1407931243,

Most services are primarily web based and provide a collection of various ways for users to interact [...]”1.

The advent and ever increasing popularity of social network services heralds a sea change in the way personal data of large populations of citizens all over the world become more or less publicly available. These services have become incredibly popular in the past years especially with young people. But increasingly such services are also being offered e.g. for professionals and the elderly.
The challenges posed by social network services are on the one hand yet another flavour of the fun- damental changes that the introduction of the Internet in the 90s of the past century has brought with it, by – inter alia – abolishing time and space in publishing information and real-time communication, and by blurring the line between service providers (authors) on the one hand and users/consumers (readers) on the other.
At the same time, social networking services seem to be pushing at the boundaries of what societies see as a person’s individual space: Personal data about individuals become publicly (and globally) available in an unprecedented way and quantity3, especially including huge quantities of digital pic- tures and videos.
With respect to privacy, one of the most fundamental challenges may be seen in the fact that most of the personal information published in social network services is being published at the initiative of the users and based on their consent. While ”traditional” privacy regulation is concerned with defin- ing rules to protect citizens against unfair or unproportional processing of personal data by the public administration (including law enforcement and secret services), and businesses, there are only very few rules governing the publication of personal data at the initiative of private individuals, partly be- cause this had not been a major issue in the “offline world”, and neither on the Internet before social network services came into being. Furthermore, the processing of personal data from public sources has traditionally been privileged in data protection and privacy legislation.",,,,,,https://datenschutz-berlin.de/attachments/897/675.36.5.pdf?1347350362,

HRPC Human Rights Protocol Considerations Research Group,Research Project,,"The Human Rights Protocol Considerations Research Group is chartered to research whether standards and protocols can enable, strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), specifically, but not limited to the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of assembly.

The research group takes as its starting point the problem statement that human-rights-enabling characteristics of the Internet might be degraded if they are not properly defined, described and sufficiently taken into account in protocol development. Not protecting these characteristics could result in (partial) loss of functionality and connectivity.

As evinced by RFC 1958, the Internet aims to be the global network of networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all users at all times and for any content. Open, secure and reliable connectivity is essential for rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of association. Since the Internet’s objective of connectivity makes it an enabler of human rights, its architectural design converges with the human rights framework.

The Internet was designed with freedom and openness of communications as core values. But as the scale and the industrialization of the Internet has grown greatly, the influence of such world-views started to compete with other values. This research group aims to explore the relations between human rights and protocols and to provide guidelines to inform future protocol development and decision making where protocol s impact the effective exercise of the rights to freedom of expression or association.

### Objective
This research has these major aims:
* To expose the relation between protocols and human rights, with a focus on the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.
* To propose guidelines to protect the Internet as a human-rights-enabling environment in future protocol development, in a manner similar to the work done for Privacy Considerations in RFC 6973.
* To increase the awareness in both the human rights community and the technical community on the importance of the technical workings of the Internet and its impact on human rights.

### Outputs
The research group plans on using a variety of research methods to create different outputs including, but not limited to:
* **Internet drafts**, some of which may be put on IRTF RFC stream. These will concern progress of the project, methodology, and will define any possible protocol considerations.
* **Policy and academic papers**, for in-depth analysis and discussion of the relationship between human rights and the Internet architecture and protocols.
* **Film and textual interviews** with a diverse set of community members, to give an accessible insight into the variety of opinions on this topic represented in the IETF.
* **Data analysis and visualization,** to research and visualize the language used in current and historic RFCs and mailinglist discussions to expose core architectural principles, language and deliberations on human rights of those affected by the network.
* **Protocol analysis.** Data analysis and visualization of (existing) protocols in the wild to research their concrete impact on human rights.",,,,,,,

The IDSP, in partnership with The Santa Fe Group's Shared Assessments Program and its Healthcare Working Group, and the Internet Security Alliance, has released a report The Financial Impact of Breached Protected Health Information: A Business Case for Enhanced PHI Security. The report is designed to help healthcare industry stakeholders entrusted with safeguarding PHI to understand the potentially devastating repercussions of a PHI breach and to provide them with a methodology for determining an appropriate level of investment needed to secure PHI [see related article](https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=3173).

The IDSP also has released workshop reports on best practices for measuring identity theft [see related article](https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=2345) and calling for a national identity verification standard [see related article](https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=2351).

IDSP workshops typically involve making an inventory of existing standards and industry guidelines in a subject area, identifying gaps where new or updated guidance may be needed, and making recommendations regarding best practices or the desirability and feasibility of undertaking standards development activity. Workshops generally have at least one face-to-face kick-off meeting. While additional meetings may be held, usually much of the work can be accomplished electronically in a working group environment. Workshops culminate in the publication of a report that presents the workshop’s consensus-based findings and recommendations, which in turn may drive future standards development activity. The IDSP itself does not develop standards.

Periodically, the IDSP has convened plenary meetings which are conferences that include reports on the progress of IDSP work underway, discussion of related identity issues, and exploration of topics that might be suitable for future workshops.",,,,,,https://www.ansi.org/standards_activities/standards_boards_panels/idsp/overview.aspx?menuid=3,

Compared to previous industrial revolutions, the fourth one is evolving at an exponential rather than at a linear pace.

This development can potentially raise globe income levels and improve the quality of life for populations around the world. It produces several effects:
* On the business side: it drastically modifies customer expectations, product enhancement, collaborative innovation and organisational forms. New technologies make assets more durable and resilient, while data and analytics change the way they are maintained.
* On governments: as new technologies increasingly enable citizens to engage with governments, while governments gain more and more tools to increase their control over population. Governments and legislators must collaborate closely with civil society to be able to properly answer to challenges.
* On people: one of the greatest challenges is on privacy, on the notion of ownership, consumer patterns and how we devote time to develop skills.

Discover eID,Publication,,"The CEF eID building block helps public administrations and private online service providers to easily extend the use of their online services to citizens from other EU Member States. It allows cross-border authentication, in a secure, reliable and trusted way, by making national electronic identification systems interoperable.
Once this building block is deployed in a Member State, the mutual recognition of national eIDs becomes possible between participating Member States, in line with the eIDAS (electronic Identification and Signature) legal framework (see eIDAS Regulation (EU) 910/2014 ) and with the privacy requirements of all the participating countries. Mutual recognition of national eIDs allows citizens of one Member State to access online services provided by public and private organisations from other participating EU Member States, using their own national eID.

 Following the successful completion of the STORK pilot programme (as described in section 2 of this document), CEF has taken on the role to 'productise' and support roll-out of eID connectivity to other Member States. This has included the development of open-source software components, documentation, training and support.

This can be likened to the situation before the Internet when there were competing non-interoperable networking technologies. The Internet makes it easy to develop networked applications independently of those technologies. W3C is seeking to do the same for the Internet of Things.

To achieve this goal, we need platform independent APIs for application developers, and a means for different platforms to discover how to inter-operate with one another. The approach we are taking is based upon rich metadata that describes the data and interaction models exposed to applications, and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively. A further aspect is the need to enable platforms to share the same meaning when they exchange data.

Global Standards Collaboration,Organization / Trade Association,,"GSC20 Communique Group
Submission/Revision date: 6th  May  2016

The Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, Security and Privacy and the Role of Small and Medium-sized Business Enterprises (SMEs) were the focus of the 20th meeting of the Global Standards Collaboration (GSC), hosted by TSDSI in New Delhi, India 26-27 April 2016.  These topics were chosen due to their significance for the development of future global communications.  Approximately one hundred people from the twelve member organizations participated in the event. 

The Internet of Things (IoT) remains a key topic for standardization and attracts interest from industry, public authorities and end users. GSC members reviewed current standardization activities focused on specific applications and use cases, such as smart cities and intelligent manufacturing. They also explored how IoT can help address global challenges such as electricity access in the developing parts of the world.  GSC agreed on the importance of increasing outreach to both end users and industry stakeholders to accelerate the development and adoption of future proof IoT standards. GSC members also addressed the risk of having a fragmented standardization landscape. They concurred that continuing to build on existing collaboration between the various standards setting organizations is vital for accelerating the successful deployment of IoT. 

5G will be instrumental in driving the ongoing digital transformation, responding to a wide variety of communication needs.  GSC members discussed current and anticipated standardization and research activities in the 5G area. They noted the importance of engaging both regulators and businesses in the development of 5G and reiterated the need for continued collaboration among SDOs. Managing scarce spectrum resources was highlighted as a particular challenge.  The non-radio aspects were also seen as key to the success of 5G, e.g.  network architecture, integrated control and management, end-to-end performance, fronthaul/backhaul.   They further noted the need to better engage developing countries in standardization efforts. 

Small and Medium-sized Business Enterprises (SMEs) play a critical role in the growth of the global economy.  Standards support innovation, competition and growth by all businesses, particularly SMEs. GSC members shared their experiences on the difficulties and barriers faced by SMEs and discussed ways to foster their involvement in standardization efforts. GSC members agreed that further collaboration and exchange of information on measures to support SMEs is needed. In particular, it was noted that better awareness among SMEs is needed on the benefits and incentives for engagement in SDOs and that efforts to facilitate their participation be promoted.  

GSC members recognized the need, in an increasingly ubiquitous digital environment, to integrate Security and Privacy (Trust) early in the innovation process, by design rather than by mere afterthought.  This requires widely understood principles to be used, in particular relating to identity, which are then applied to the particular technology areas. Further concerted global dialogue and standardization across verticals and across SDOs was highlighted as an urgent priority, with a view to developing consistent and harmonized standards.  Human–centric innovation and standardization, in which both technological and societal considerations work hand in hand, was seen to be in the interest of businesses and consumers alike. GSC members further noted the need to align and adapt existing standards to increasingly diverse security and privacy requirements arising from the advent of IoT, M2M (machine-to-machine), Cloud, big data and smart environments.",,,,,,,

"Social Security Numbers, Public Records, and Identity Theft",Publication,,"There is a very important principle to understand that applies directly to the discussion of the use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and whether this information should be removed from public documents. This principle is neither controversial nor complicated and should be very easily grasped by almost anyone.
The principle is: Identity information cannot be both public and secret.
Names, by themselves, are not unique and are not a reliable identifier. Without pairing a name with secondary information such as a SSN many false positive and false negative conclusions and outcomes result. In the United States, much of this secondary information, used for the legitimate purposes of identification, comes from public records. The use of SSNs helps to properly identify people. To meet this need, the SSN has been treated as public information and used extensively to link people to their information to conduct legitimate societal functions. Without a clear and complete public record that includes identity information, there cannot be fairness for the blameless or consequences for the culpable.
There is a pervasive need throughout society to uniquely identify individuals to facilitate the conduct of business, government, and even social interactions. Without this ability, a government agency cannot ensure it is providing benefits to the proper citizens or that criminals are properly prosecuted. Similarly, financial institutions and employers may wrongly offer or deny credit or employment because of inaccurate credit and background histories.
Poorly conceived and implemented identity practices have resulted in readily available personal information such as SSNs being inappropriately used as authenticators or “keys” to accounts and other valuable resources. These improper practices have made SSNs valuable to criminals. Current defense mechanisms, when deployed and properly used, competently defend against intrusions based on simple knowledge of SSNs and other personal information.
Information such as the SSN that has been public is all but impossible to make secret. Therefore, redacting SSNs and other personal information from public documents will provide virtually no benefit in reducing identity crimes and may hinder or damage current legitimate and successful efforts to do so. Society wide redaction of SSNs and other personal identifiers from public records will be very expensive and disruptive of beneficial processes but will not result in personal information being unavailable.
Resources can be more successfully employed to advance the implementation and use of better identity tools and practices and to educate individuals on how to protect themselves against identity crimes. Redaction cannot, and will not, stop identity theft. When redaction is proposed as the solution to the problem of identity theft, there is only one answer that makes sense: “Just say no.”",,,,,,http://www.cspra.us/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/SSNsinPublicRecords.31983038.pdf,

Information technology – Personal identification – ISO- compliant driving license (18013),Specification,,"This part of ISO/IEC 18013 establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO compliant driving licence (IDL) in regard to both visual human-readable features and ISO machine-readable technologies. It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without impeding individual national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their specific needs.
The design approach of the IDL ISO ID-1 size card and accompanying booklet with sleeve insert pocket is intended to replace the international driving permit (IDP) paper document (see annex G).
The basis of document design premises includes:
* a minimum common mandatory data element set; 
* a common layout for ease of recognition; 
* minimum security requirements.

At the discretion of national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities, it
* allows for inclusion of supplementary optional data elements to meet the needs of specific national/community/regional requirements apart from the minimum common mandatory data element set; 
* allows for the incorporation of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 machine-readable technologies including magnetic stripe, integrated circuit with contacts, contactless integrated circuit and optical memory technology, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC31 1-dimensional / 2-dimensional bar codes, at the option of national/community/regional authorities;
* allows for the incorporation of current and future technologies (including biometrics, cryptography, data compression) at the option of national/community/regional authorities;
* allows for additional document physical security elements at the option of national/community/regional authorities, and facilitates international procurements.

A major benefit of these design premises is that a single card may serve a dual purpose of both a national/community/regional licence as well as an internationally recognized licence. Therefore, one card, in some cases, can replace the need for two documents. Alternatively, those countries that choose to maintain their individual domestic design can issue a second card with or without ISO machine-readable technologies to replace the current IDP paper document.

This new IDL design yields a document that:
* is more secure from counterfeiting and alteration than the previous IDP document;
* allows authorities to verify the authenticity of the document;
* integrates the personal data into a secure ID-1 size medium;
* allows a more reliable identification of the licence holder;
* allows for machine-readable technologies;
* facilitates information exchange and mutual recognition among motor vehicle authorities;
* allows the domestic driving licence (DDL) that meets this Standard to serve simultaneously as an ISO compliant driving licence (IDL).

ISO/IEC 18013 establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to human-readable features (ISO/IEC 18013-1), ISO machine-readable technologies (ISO/IEC 18013-2), and access control, authentication and integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013-3). It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without impeding individual countries/states in applying their privacy rules and national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their specific needs.
The purpose of storing IDL data on machine-readable media on the IDL is to
* increase productivity (of data and IDL use), 
* facilitate electronic data exchange,
* assist in authenticity and integrity validation.

part of ISO/IEC 18013 thus specifies the following: 
* mandatory and optional machine-readable data;
* the logical data structure;
* encoding rules for the machine-readable technologies currently supported.

To prevent unauthorised access to the data contained on a contactless integrated circuit (e.g. by eavesdropping), provision is made to protect the privacy of the licence holder via basic access protection [requiring a human- readable and/or machine-readable key/password on the IDL to access the data on the contactless integrated circuit (via protected-channel communication)]. The implementation details of this function however are defined in ISO/IEC 18013-3.
Provision is made for issuing authorities to validate the authenticity and integrity of the mandatory and optional data. In addition, the option of protecting access to optional data (beyond basic access protection) is provided for. The exact mechanism used to achieve such protection (e.g. encryption and/or additional access control) is specified in ISO/IEC 18013-3.

This International Standard establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to Human-readable features (Part 1), Machine-readable technologies (Part 2), and Access control, authentication and integrity validation (Part 3). It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without impeding individual countries/states to apply their privacy rules and national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their specific needs.
This Part of ISO/IEC 18013:
*  Is based on the machine-readable data content specified in ISO/IEC 18013-2.
*  Specifies mechanisms and rules available to issuing authorities for:
(a) Access control (i.e. limiting access to the machine readable data recorded on the IDL).
(b) Document authentication (i.e. confirming that the document was issued by the claimed issuing authority). 
(c) Data integrity validation (i.e. confirming that the data was not changed since issuing).

This Part of ISO/IEC 18013 does not address issues related to the subsequent use of data obtained from the IDL, e.g. privacy issues.",,,,,,,

GAIA Global Access to the Internet for All Research Group,Research Project,,"The Internet Society’s Global Internet User Survey 2012 reveals that a large majority of respondents believe that Internet access should be considered a basic human right. However, in the reality of today’s Internet, the vision of global access to the Internet faces the challenge of a growing digital divide, i.e., a growing disparity between those with sufficient access to the Internet and those who cannot afford access to the essential services provided by the Internet.

Access problems often result from sparsely spread populations living in physically remote locations, since it is simply not cost effective for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to install the required infrastructure for broadband Internet access to these areas. In addition to the physical limitations of terrestrial infrastructures (mainly due to distance) to provide last mile access, remote communities also incur higher costs for connection between the exchange and backbone network when using wired technologies. A large exchange may accommodate many users and allow for competition between service operators; in contrast, a rural/remote broadband exchange often does not offer economies of scale, raising the costs per user. Thus, although service requirements for customers in rural/remote areas and cities are identical, the delivery and pricing mechanisms need to be different. This requirement is also applicable to urban areas where cost of access is considered as a major impediment for wider access.

Addressing digital exclusion due to socio-economic barriers is also extremely important. The United Nations revealed the global disparity in fixed broadband access, showing that access to fixed broadband mainly in less- developed countries costs almost 40 times their national average income. This problem is even encountered in developed countries, where many individuals find themselves unable to pass a necessary credit check or live in circumstances that are too unstable to commit to lengthy broadband contracts.

There are policy and research challenges at the level of social science, economics and technology to the realisation of a future Internet capability that will offer unfettered access to all parts of society. There can be no single uniform solution that embraces all types of user and all locations, given the impact that social aspects (such as different human needs and aspirations) have on building technological solutions. It is important to emphasize that there also is room for innovation and experimentation in policy. The major obstacles to more persistent and affordable access in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, the Middle East, and other regions are not technological but regulatory. There is a need for innovative regulation and reformed public policy to enable new business models and wireless technologies to flourish. Moreover, the social science dimension of an universal Internet must not be forgotten, capturing the impact of human values on the design decisions of underlying solutions on the one hand and the impact of the Internet on the human value network on the other hand.

### Objectives
The Global Access to the Internet for All Research Group (GAIA) is an IRTF initiative that aims
1. to create increased visibility and interest among the wider community on the challenges and opportunities in enabling global Internet access, in terms of technology as well as the social and economic drivers for its adoption;
2. to create a shared vision among practitioners, researchers, corporations, non governmental and governmental organisations on the challenges and opportunities;
3. to articulate and foster collaboration among them to address the diverse Internet access and architectural challenges (including security, privacy, censorship and energy efficiency);
4. to document and share deployment experiences and research results to the wider community through scholarly publications, white papers, presentations, workshops, Informational and Experimental RFCs;
5. to document the costs of existing Internet Access, the breakdown of those costs (energy, manpower, licenses, bandwidth, infrastructure, transit, peering), and outline a path to achieve a 10x reduction in Internet Access costs especially in geographies and populations with low penetration.
6. to develop a longer term perspective on the impact of GAIA research group findings on the standardisation efforts at the IETF. This could include recommendations to protocol designers and architects.",,,,,,https://irtf.org/gaia,

“Identity” Commandments,Publication,,"The Jericho Forum Identity, Entitlement & Access Management (IdEA) Commandments define the principles that must be observed when planning an identity eco-system.
Whilst building on “good practice”, these commandments specifically address those areas that will allow “identity” processes to operate on a global, de-perimeterised scale; this necessitates open and interoperable standards and a commitment to implement such standards by both identity providers and identity consumers
.
The IdEA commandments serve as a benchmark by which Identity, Entitlement and Access Management concepts, solutions, standards and systems can be assessed and measured. They are supported by a Jericho Forum IdEA Glossary and other related documents. They also build on the higher level Jericho Forum Commandments, in particular Commandments 2, 8, 9 and 10.

Identity and Core Identity
1. All core identities must be protected to ensure their secrecy and integrity
2. Identifiers must be able to be trusted
3. The authoritative source of identity will be the unique identifier or credentials offered by the persona representing that entity

Multiple Identities (Persona)
4. An Entity can have multiple, separate Persona (Identities) and related
unique identifiers
5. Persona must, in specific use cases, be able to be seen as the same

Persona (Identity) Attributes
6. The attribute owner is responsible for the protection and appropriate
disclosure of the attribute
7. Connecting attributes to persona must be simple and verifiable
8. The source of the attribute should be as close to the authoritative source as
possible

Entitlement management and resource access
9. A resource owner must define Entitlement (Resource Access Rules)
10.Access decisions must be relevant, valid and bi-directional

Usage and Delegation
11. Users of an entity’s attributes are accountable for protecting the attributes
12.Principals can delegate authority to another to act on behalf of a persona
13.Authorised Principals may acquire access to (seize) another entity’s persona
14.A persona may represent, or be represented by, more than one entity 

Conclusion
The shift from Enterprise and Application or System Centric Identity and Access Management to User and Resource Centric Identity, Entitlement and Access Management holds the triple promises of Lower Cost, Higher Security/Trust and Increased Flexibility. These benefits will have a major positive impact on the way the world will innovate and trade. The new frame must however be managed with the context created by these Commandments to gain these benefits.

There is also a major infrastructure investment required to create the next generation “Identity” Management approach. This investment in turn requires a shift in the business model and the enthusiastic uptake of the services that will encourage a cultural shift that will value Transparency as much as it does Privacy. Open access to the reputation of entities will go a long way to raising the eTrust barrier.",,,,,,https://collaboration.opengroup.org/jericho/Jericho%20Forum%20Identity%20Commandments%20v1.0.pdf,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_Forum

General Data Protection Regulation,Legislation,,"The Reform consists of two instruments:
* The General Data Protection Regulation will enable people to better control their personal data. At the same time modernised and unified rules will allow businesses to make the most of the opportunities of the Digital Single Market by cutting red tape and benefiting from reinforced consumer trust.
* The Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector will ensure that the data of victims, witnesses, and suspects of crimes, are duly protected in the context of a criminal investigation or a law enforcement action. At the same time more harmonised laws will also facilitate cross-border cooperation of police or prosecutors to combat crime and terrorism more effectively across Europe. 

A fundamental right for citizens
The reform will allow people to regain control of their personal data. Two-thirds of Europeans (67%), according to a recent Eurobarometer survey, stated they are concerned about not having complete control over the information they provide online. Seven Europeans out of ten worry about the potential use that companies may make of the information disclosed. The data protection reform will strengthen the right to data protection, which is a fundamental right in the EU, and allow them to have trust when they give their personal data.

The new rules address these concerns by strengthening the existing rights and empowering individuals with more control over their personal data. Most notably, these include:
* easier access to your own data: individuals will have more information on how their data is processed and this information should be available in a clear and understandable way;
* a right to data portability: it will be easier to transfer your personal data between service providers;
* aclarified ""right to be forgotten"": when you no longer want your data to be processed, and provided that there are no legitimate grounds for retaining it, the data will be deleted;
* the right to know when your data has been hacked: For example, companies and organisations must notify the national supervisory authority of serious data breaches as soon as possible so that users can take appropriate measures. 

Clear modern rules for businesses
In today's digital economy, personal data has acquired enormous economic significance, in particular in the area of big data. By unifying Europe's rules on data protection, lawmakers are creating a business opportunity and encouraging innovation.
* One continent, one law: The regulation will establish one single set of rules which will make it simpler and cheaper for companies to do business in the EU.
* One-stop-shop: businesses will only have to deal with one single supervisory authority. This is estimated to save €2.3 billion per year.
* European rules on European soil– companies based outside of Europe will have to apply the same rules when offering services in the EU.
* Risk-based approach: the rules will avoid a burdensome one-size-fits-all obligation and rather tailor them to the respective risks.
* Rules fit for innovation: the regulation will guarantee that data protection safeguards are built into products and services from the earliest stage of development (Data protection by design). Privacy-friendly techniques such as pseudonomysation will be encouraged, to reap the benefits of big data innovation while protecting privacy. 

Benefits for big and small alike
The data protection reform will stimulate economic growth by cutting costs and red tape for European business, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The EU's data protection reform will help SMEs break into new markets. Under the new rules, SMEs will benefit from four reductions in red tape:
* No more notifications: Notifications to supervisory authorities are a formality that represents a cost for business of €130 million every year. The reform will scrap these entirely.
* Every penny counts: Where requests to access data are manifestly unfounded or excessive, SMEs will be able to charge a fee for providing access.
* Data Protection Officers: SMEs are exempt from the obligation to appoint a data protection officer insofar as data processing is not their core business activity.
* Impact Assessments: SMEs will have no obligation to carry out an impact assessment unless there is a high risk. 

Protecting personal data in the area of law enforcement
* Better cooperation between law enforcement authorities
With the new Data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities, law enforcement authorities in EU Member States will be able to exchange information necessary for investigations more efficiently and effectively, improving cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime in Europe.
The Data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities takes account of the specific needs of law enforcement, respects the different legal traditions in Member States and is fully in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  
Better protection of citizens 'data
Individuals' personal data will be better protected, whenprocessed for any law enforcement purpose including prevention of crime. It will protect everyone – regardless of whether they are a victim, criminal or witness. All law enforcement processing in the Union must comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality and legality, with appropriate safeguards for the individuals. Supervision is ensured by independent national data protection authorities, and effective judicial remedies must be provided.
The Data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities provides clear rules for the transfer of personal data by law enforcement authorities outside the EU, to ensure that the level of protection of individuals guaranteed in the EU is not undermined. 

Next steps
Following political agreement reached in trilogue, the final texts will be formally adopted by the European Parliament and Council at the beginning 2016. The new rules will become applicable two years thereafter.
The Commission will work closely with Member State Data protection authorities to ensure a uniform application of the new rules. During the two-year transition phase, the Commission will inform citizens about their rights and companies about their obligations.
Data Protection Authorities will work more closely together in the future, especially through the one-stop shop mechanism to solve cross-border data protection cases. 

Background
The Data protection package is a key enabler of the Digital Single Market and the EU Agenda on Security.
Proposed by then EU Justice Commissioner, Vice-President Viviane Reding in January 2012 (see IP/12/46), the data protection reform package includes the General Data Protection Regulation and the data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice Authorities. It updates and replaces the current Data protection rules that are based on the 1995 Data Protection Directive and the 2008 Framework Decision for the police and criminal justice sector.",,,,,,http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6321_en.htm,

eInvoicing Introduction,Publication,,"eInvoicing represents a clear example of how digital innovation can provide efficiencies and cost-cutting measures of tangible benefit to public administrations, citizens and businesses throughout Europe. Since 2001, European legislation has given electronic invoices legal equivalence with their paper counterparts.

However, in recent years, the proliferation of eInvoicing standards and syntaxes coexisting in the Member States led to increased complexity in term of cross-border interoperability. Additionally, the take-up of electronic invoices in public administrations is still rather low despite the many benefits offered (savings, simplification, etc.).

As a consequence, the European Parliament and Council voted on the 16th of April 2014 Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement. The Directive calls for the definition of a common European standard at semantic level and additional standardisation deliverables which will enhance interoperability at the syntax level.

Additionally, it will become mandatory for all contracting authorities and contracting entities to receive and process eInvoices complying with the European standard, starting in November 2018.

The definition of the eInvoicing European standard will be carried out by CEN , a European Standardisation Organisation; CEN will use the work of existing standardisation initiatives such as CEN BII workshops agreement or “European Multi-stakeholder Forum on eInvoicing” recommendations as a baseline.

The European Commission shall assist CEN in the European standard definition, and provide guidance to Member States in the implementation of the Directive. These actions will be funded by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) through a work programme of € 9 million over 4 years.

This action will be undertaken by the eInvoicing building block Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI).

The purpose of the eInvoicing building block is to promote the uptake and accelerate the use of eInvoicing respecting the European standard, amongst both public and private entities established in the EU, as well as in participating EEA countries.

The purpose of this document is to provide a general introduction to the eInvoicing building block of CEF Telecom.

The CEF building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU.
The promotion of common building blocks is a way to lower barriers for technical integration and provide tried and tested solutions that will speed up the delivery of Digital Public Services in a cost efficient manner.

The technical management of the eInvoicing DSI is carried out by the Directorate-General for Informatics (DIGIT ) of the European Commission.

Implementation of the EU policy directly related to eInvoicing is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROWTH ) of the European Commission.

The Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA ) is responsible for the implementation of the CEF Telecom programme grants in cooperation with the Commission.
The CEF building blocks are coordinated and managed by the Directorate- General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT r ) of the European Commission.",,,,,,https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eInvoicing+Discover?preview=/23003331/24841295/DSI_IntroDocument%20(eInvoicing)-v1.2.pdf,

Open PEPPOL,Organization / Trade Association,,"The OpenPEPPOL Association was established on 1st September 2012 after successful completion of the Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL) project which saw PEPPOL specifications being implemented in several European countries solving interoperability issues for electronic procurement .

OpenPEPPOL is a non-profit international association under Belgian law (Association Internationale Sans But Lucratif – AISBL) and consists of both public sector and private members. The association has assumed full responsibility for the development and maintenance of the PEPPOL specifications, building blocks and its services and implementation across Europe.

The purpose of OpenPEPPOL is to enable European businesses to easily deal electronically with any European public sector buyers in their procurement processes, thereby increasing opportunities for greater competition for government contracts and providing better value for tax payers’ money.

The Association provides an authoritative point of reference for networks of interoperable, PEPPOL-compliant infrastructure and the organisations that use it, ensuring high level governance and continuation of the agreement infrastructure. OpenPEPPOL is working towards providing its stakeholders with widely accepted technology standards and specifications, while ensuring sustainability and promoting and supporting the wider use of the PEPPOL specifications, building blocks and services.

Business to business use of the PEPPOL-compliant infrastructure and use of PEPPOL-components in other areas beyond procurement are also recognised as important and is encouraged by the Association.

NFVRG Network Function Virtualization Research Group,Research Project,,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a key emerging area for network operators, hardware and software vendors, cloud service providers, and in general network practitioners and researchers. This area requires exploring new directions and working collaboratively on how to create network services that utilize a virtualized infrastructure. Network functions that are traditionally implemented in dedicated hardware appliances will need to be decomposed and executed in software elements running on cloud-based infrastructures. One essential goal of this new approach is to reduce capital and operating expenditures for future deployments for networks and associated services. Another important goal is for the network operators to be able to offer value added cloud services to their customers. Finally, new business models will open for the provision of network services.

The technologies enabling the virtualization of network functions (NFs) are currently in an early stage, and they need researchers to develop new architectures, systems, and software, and to explore trade-offs and possibilities for leveraging virtualized infrastructure to provide support for network functions. The Network Function Virtualization Research Group (NFVRG) will bring together researchers and grow the community around the world in both academia and industry to explore this new research area. Beyond the direct activity through the IRTF collaboration tools it will organize research group meetings and workshops at premier conferences (such as IEEE ICC, IEEE GLOBECOM) and inviting special issues in well-known publications.

The NFVRG will focus on research problems associated with NFV-related topics and on bringing a research community together that can jointly address them, concentrating on problems that relate not just to networking but also to computing and storage aspects in such environments. It is hoped that the outcome of the research will benefit research efforts in other groups within the IRTF (and especially the SDNRG) and standardization activities of IETF WGs (like the ones going in SFC). Specific results can also spawn activities via IRTF & IETF BoF meetings and/or provide useful input to other related efforts in the ETSI NFV ISG or other standards bodies.",,,,,2015-01-20,https://irtf.org/nfvrg,

With the Federal Office for Information Technology founded in 2006, the BVA has been running one of the first IT services centres of the Federal Government. One of the BIT’s tasks is to consolidate the IT systems of the subordinate authorities of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, i. e. to concentrate them in a few selected computer centres. The BVA advises both on modernization of IT based administration processes and on specialised IT issues. About 230 institutions already use BIT products and services, including the Federal Chancellery, the Bundestag, and the federal ministries.

ICCRG Internet Congestion Control Research Group,Research Project,,"Key to the correct functioning of the Internet is TCP’s congestion control mechanism, which serves to match offered load to available bandwidth. Congestion control also allocates available bandwidth to many flows, more or less reasonably. Since the deployment of TCP’s additive-increase, multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm in 1988, the Internet has changed significantly, becoming much more heterogeneous in many areas including link speeds and characteristics, and types of application. Although there is no immediate crisis, TCP’s AIMD algorithm is showing its limits in a number of areas, including but not limited to:

insufficient dynamic range to handle high-speed wide-area networks (especially with few sources using them)
poor performance over links with unpredictable characteristics, such as some forms of wireless link.
poor latency characteristics for competing real-time flows.
The network research community has been very active in designing modifications and alternatives to TCP’s basic AIMD algorithm, especially when it comes to high-speed congestion control. A non-exhaustive list of examples includes High-speed TCP, Scalable TCP, H-TCP, FAST, and XCP. However the network research community cannot, by itself, effectively evaluate any such solution for Internet-scale deployment. To do this requires the involvement of equipment vendors, network operators, and other IETF participants, in addition to the research community.

The key goal of the Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG) therefore is to move towards consensus on which technologies are viable long-term solutions for the Internet congestion control architecture, and what an appropriate cost/benefit tradeoff is.

To achieve this goal will require extensive evaluation of different mechanisms in a wide range of network conditions, using a mix of simulation, analysis, and experiment. It is unclear at this stage whether any single proposed solution is viable, or whether there needs to be a synthesis of ideas from many places.

Such an evaluation is especially difficult, given that some mechanisms involve changes to queuing algorithms, or to packet forwarding, whereas others only require end-system modifications. It is difficult therefore to compare like with like. One goal of the ICCRG is to improve our methods for evaluating transport protocols. To this end, a set of simulation (or other) test suites will be developed. There is an opportunity when making any widespread change to go further than the simplest incremental modifications, but such larger changes have costs, and so critical to the relevance of any recommendations from the ICCRG will be that any proposed solutions are considered to be economically viable. If router modifications are proposed, collecting them and the tradeoff underlying them would be an important service of the ICCRG.

There are many different aspects to congestion control that the ICCRG should consider. For example, different real-time media applications have (to a greater or lesser extent) a difficult time with dynamic congestion control mechanisms, especially if changes must be made on short timescales. The rise of Internet telephony and the expected rise of high-bandwidth Internet television will therefore significantly impact the congestion control landscape. The ICCRG should therefore consider such applications, both in terms of how to best support these various classes of application, and in terms of how this impacts the overall emerging congestion control architecture.

Also within scope for the ICCRG should be consideration of how congestion control interacts with QoS mechanisms, with traffic engineering, and with lower-layer technologies such as optical-burst-switching. Finally, of significant importance is the interaction between denial-of-service attacks targeted at bandwidth exhaustion, any mechanisms intended to prevent such attacks, and the congestion control architecture. Thus the context for the work of this group is necessarily wide-reaching, and touches on both architecture and mechanism.

Because congestion control is typically a key function of transport protocols, it is hard to separate other transport layer issues from congestion control. Considerations for deployment of transport protocols are therefore also considered within scope. The ICCRG may also consider congestion and protocol performance problems in general IP networks, i.e., not only on the global Internet. One example of such IP networks are multi-tenant, heterogeneous datacenters, which in some sense represent a microcosm of the larger Internet; changes to the transport protocols being considered in that space are fundamental and can have broader implications.",,,,,,https://irtf.org/iccrg,

The eIDAS Regulation:
* ensures that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services in other EU countries where eIDs are available.
* creates an European internal market for eTS - namely electronic signatures, electronic seals, time stamp, electronic delivery service and website authentication - by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper based processes. Only by providing certainty on the legal validity of all these services, businesses and citizens will use the digital interactions as their natural way of interaction.

With eIDAS, the EU has managed to lay down the right foundations and a predictable legal framework for people, companies (in particular SMEs) and public administrations to safely access to services and do transactions online and across border in just ""one click"". Indeed, rolling out eIDAS means higher security and more convenience for any online activity such submitting tax declarations, enrolling in a foreign university, remotely opening a bank account, setting up a business in another Member State, authenticating for internet payments, bidding to on line call for tender, etc.",,,,,,https://www.eid.as/home/,

Following a proposal for setting up an Internet registry for Africa by several early Internet adopters in Africa, during an INET workshop in Malaysia (1997),  a steering commmitte was set up to work on AFRINIC's structure and business plan. 

The idea behind the initiative was to adapt the allocation policies applied by the already established RIRs (RIPE NCC and APNIC) to Africa’s realities. In 2000 this proposal resulted in a consensus with the setup of AfNOG (the African Network Operators group).

Moreover during the same year, the first AFRINIC observers were appointed to the Address Supporting Organization Address Council (ASO AC). In 2001, the steering commitee recomended the appointment of an initial Board of Trustees based on sub-regional representation. Dr Nii Quaynor chaired the first AFRINIC Board  with the mission to formalise the organisation and work towards its accreditation as a Regional Internet Registry (RIR).

The notices are often unreadable, unclear, and not useful in practice. They provide limited guidance for people and few benefits to the companies and organisations who issue them. Open Notice is an effort that calls for an open, global, and public infrastructure for legally required, digitally necessary consent-based notices.

Future Security: Security Research Conference,Event,Europe,"»Sensor Systems for Safety and Security«
In most industrialized countries, in particular within Europe, a high level of both safety and security has been reached. However, it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain or to increase this standard even further, given the great challenges and current threats Europe is facing. Upholding and restoring the necessary level of safety and security we are accustomed to requires the development and implementation of innovative technical solutions such as intelligent sensing systems and sensor networks. These hold the promise that hazards and threats can be detected early enough to avoid severe adverse impact, while still allowing people to travel and move freely as well as maintaining free trade and circulation of goods.

At the same time, smart factories and intelligent logistics based on cyber-physical systems and the internet of things (IoT), also referred to as Industry 4.0, pose new challenges with respect to operational safety. Advanced sensors and sensor networks are required e.g. for the safe operation of autonomous mobile systems.  

To provide valid solutions to all these challenges, a cross-disciplinary collaboration of researchers from natural sciences, engineering, humanities and social sciences is required. To foster the communication and interaction among these different communities on this very topic, the »Future Security« conference series provides an interdisciplinary exchange platform for scientists, experts and actors from research, industry, public bodies and authorities. This conference provides direct insight into current security research activities and hot topics in this field.

CREDENTIAL,Research Project,Europe,"CREDENTIAL is a EU funded research project developing, testing and showcasing innovative cloud-based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other highly critical personal data with a demonstrably higher level of security than other current solutions.
The main idea and ambition of CREDENTIAL is to enable end-to-end security and improved privacy in cloud identity management services for managing secure access control. This is achieved by advancing novel cryptographic technologies and improving strong authentication mechanisms.

 
 Summary
With increasing mobility and Internet usage, the demand for digital services increases and has reached critical and high assurance domains like e-Government, e-Health and e-Business. Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs. The goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes. The use of sophisticated proxy cryptography schemes will enable a secure and privacy preserving information sharing network for cloud-based identity information in which even the identity provider cannot access the data in plain-text and hence protect access to identity data. We focus not only on evaluating and applying novel crypto-approaches for IAMs but also on implementing them in an easy-to-use way to motivate secure handling of identity data. In order to also address security, privacy and trust issues related to the used cloud platforms and services we will investigate assurance and resilience approaches for enhancing underlying cloud services. To empirically evaluate our work and to produce outputs of a high technical readiness we will consider use cases from all three domains mentioned above.

The project CREDENTIAL is scheduled for 36 months and the work plan is defined in accordance with the objectives of the project, and organised according to the expertise of the partners. The work plan is organised in seven work packages and their relation and interdependencies is shown in the figure.

The CREDENTIAL consortium is composed of a balanced team of 5 industry partners, 2 applied research organisations, an SMEs and 3 universities, which are complementary in their expertise and have strong experience in their respective fields, i.e. identify and access management, cloud computing, information security and usability aspects. The partners are from 7 different EU member states and they were carefully selected to cover the complete value chain from theory to practice to maximize the impact and exploitation potential.",,,,,,,

Working Paper on Intelligent Video Analytics,Publication,,"Increasingly, intelligent video analytics1 technologies are being used to detect and track individu- als in order to deliver customized advertising, enhanced security, and customer management solutions. They do this by providing detailed audience measurement information and offering new channels and media to communicate with individuals. For example, the digital signage market is expected to be worth $23.76 Billion in 2020, growing rapidly at a compound annual growth rate of
8.18% between 2015 and 20202.

This paper addresses the use of intelligent video analytics technologies by both private and pub- lic sector. The technologies that are the subject of this paper are used to detect and/or track indi- viduals and objects, but not to identify them. This paper applies to upgrades to existing video sur- veillance systems, standalone “smart CCTV” or digital signage systems through the addition of intelligent video analytics capabilities, as well as new, purpose-built systems incorporating these technologies. This paper explores the privacy implications of these technologies and provides recommendations for transparent and privacy-friendly implementations.

Working Paper on Mobile processing of Personal Data and Security,Publication,,"In April 2004, the Working Group adopted a Working Paper on the potential privacy risks associated 1
Since that time, due to the strongly increasing dissemination and diversity of mobile devices such as, for example, mobile phones, smart phones, laptops and PDAs, accompanied by the constant avail- ability of public communication networks, data processing of all manner of confidential and personal data on potentially insecure devices in potentially insecure public environments is becoming increas- ingly easy.
The use of mobile devices is not solely limited to the maintenance of contact data and processing of calendar entries. Rather, it makes confidential and personal data in corporate databases or the use of cloud computing services easily accessible.
The constantly increasing storage capacities of mobile devices and the ever-increasing speed of wireless networks allow mobile data processing in a way that was only possible in fixed and more secure environments in the past. The increased integration of mobile applications in conventional company IT infrastructures and processes increasingly results in confidential, personal, as well as business critical data not just being stored in the central system, but also being processed on the mobile devices.

eSignature Introduction,Publication,,"The eSignature building block helps public administrations and businesses to accelerate the creation and verification of electronic signatures. The deployment of solutions based on this building block in a Member State facilitates the mutual recognition and cross-border interoperability of eSignatures. This means that public administrations and businesses can trust and use eSignatures that are valid and structured in EU interoperable formats.

The purpose of this document is to provide a general introduction to the eSignature Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI), part of the Telecom Programme of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF Telecom).

eSignature is a building block of CEF. These building blocks are reusable specifications, software and services that will form part of a wide variety of IT systems in different policy domains of the EU.

The promotion of common building blocks is a way to lower barriers for technical integration and provide tried and tested solution components that will speed up the delivery of Digital Public Services, that work across borders, in a cost efficient manner.

The technical management of the eSignature DSI is done by the Directorate General for Informatics (DIGIT ) of the European Commission.

Implementation of the EU policy directly related to eSignature is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT ) of the European Commission.

ICNRG Information-Centric Networking Research Group,Research Project,,"Distributing and manipulating named information is a major application in the Internet today. In addition to web-based content distribution, other distribution technologies (such as P2P and CDN) have emerged and are promoting a communication model of accessing data by name, regardless of origin server location.

In order to respond to increasing traffic volume in the current Internet for applications such as mobile video and cloud computing, a set of disparate technologies and distribution services are employed that employ caching, replication and content distribution in different specific ways. These approaches are currently deployed in separate silos – different CDN providers and P2P applications rely on proprietary distribution technologies. It is not possible to uniquely and securely identify named information independently of the distribution channel; and the different distribution approaches are typically implemented as an overlay, leading to unnecessary inefficiency.

Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to directly support this use by introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle. Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. These concepts are known under different terms, including but not limited to: Network of Information (NetInf), Named Data Networking (NDN) and Publish/Subscribe Networking.

ICN concepts can be applied to different layers of the protocol stack: name-based data access can be implemented on top of the existing IP infrastructure, e.g., by providing resource naming, ubiquitous caching and corresponding transport services, or it can be seen as a packet-level internetworking technology that would cause fundamental changes to Internet routing and forwarding. In summary, ICN is expected to evolve the Internet architecture at different layers.

Research Challenges
The research challenges for ICN include:
* Naming schemes for ICN, including scalable name resolution for flat names
Scalable routing schemes
* Congestion control, QoS approaches, and caching strategies
* Metrics that make it possible to evaluate ICN implementations in a consistent manner
* Security and privacy, including scoping of information objects and access control to them
* Application/application-protocol design and APIs
* Business, legal and regulatory frameworks

Moving the focus from nodes to information objects raises scalability issues to a new level. Currently, the Internet is addressing on the order of 10^9 nodes, whereas the number of addressable ICN objects is expected to be several orders of magnitude higher. Name-based routing and name resolution have to be designed to scale accordingly, also considering mobility support and disruption tolerance. This is related to the question how objects are actually named, e.g., using flat labels with name/content integrity or more structured, possibly aggregatable names.

### ICNRG Objectives
The main objective of the ICNRG is to couple ongoing ICN research in the above areas with solutions that are relevant for evolving the Internet at large.

The ICNRG will produce a document that provides guidelines for experimental activities in the area of ICN so that different, alternative solutions can be compared consistently, and information sharing accomplished for experimental deployments.

The ICNRG will initiate discussions about the desirable interfaces/APIs to an ICN, as relevant from, e.g. the perspective the application layer and from network management.

Specifically, the ICNRG is focusing on the following short-term goals:
* To produce a document that provides a survey of different approaches and techniques
* To produce a document that describes the ICN problem statement, the main concepts and research challenges in depth
* To define reference baseline scenarios to enable performance comparisons between different approaches",,,,,,https://irtf.org/icnrg,

Civil Registry Consolidation through Digital Identity Management,Publication,,"A number of developing countries have decided to implement electronic identity programs to uniquely establish their citizen’s identity, and to achieve solid development outputs, through the efficient delivery of both private and public services. eIDs bring security and convenience, and contribute to the acceleration of economic and social development in developing countries. However, in order to allow the population to fully benefit from these initiatives an integrated approach - that includes civil registration - has to be taken into consideration.
The civil register is the foundational registry at the center of an ID ecosystem. It cannot be replaced by identity programs but it can be deeply strengthened by them. A holistic approach, with a circular and dynamic link between civil registration and eID systems, is the only way to reach universal coverage while providing robust credentials.

Many organizations, among which the United Nations and the World Bank for example, provide recommendations and funding to countries that need them. It is crucial that such advice and initiatives for the sustainable implementation of an eCivil registration include the right balance between legislative guidance, technical requirements and organizational support.
The establishment of a legal and administrative framework needs to empower a competent and independent agency to drive the modernization for the civil registry. When jurisdictional culture and national laws allow for it, a centralized organization can facilitate communication between information systems and enable nationwide harmonization of registration and data standards. Moreover, safeguards and integrity of collected data must be included in this legislation from the very beginning.

The switch to the digitalization of civil registration records is crucial to implementing a secured national identity platform. Indeed, computerization allows interoperability with mobile and card technologies. It provides an efficient tool to extend the coverage of registration and identification, and streamlines processes and securely stores data. It is also a strong enabler for the production of continuous and complete vital statistics. The adequate training of civil officers is also a key step in the modernization of the civil registration.

The use of the Personal Identification Number (PIN) given at birth or during ad-hoc census, and shared across different government databases, can provide a common and neutral entry to retrieve other identification elements in databases to ensure convenience, security and accuracy. As soon as the capture of biometric data is feasible, their association with this number will strengthen the reliability of the identity assertion.",,,,,,https://www.secureidentityalliance.org/index.php/news-events/news/325-new-civil-registry-and-identity-guidance-for-governments,

Moreover, security and privacy technologies originally were developed in a context in which system administrators had primary responsibility for security and privacy protections and in which the users tended to be sophisticated. Today, the user base is much wider--including the vast majority of employees in many organizations and a large fraction of households--but the basic models for security and privacy are essentially unchanged.",,,,,,http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12998/toward-better-usability-security-and-privacy-of-information-technology-report,

IEEE SecDev 2016,Event,,"In this first year, IEEE Cybersecurity Development (SecDev) 2016 is soliciting short papers that present innovations, experience-based insights, or a vision. The goal is to share useful and thought provoking ideas, to push forward the art and science of secure development. In future years, the academic portion of SecDev will expand to include more complete articles.

SecDev is a new venue for presenting ideas, research, and experience about how to develop secure systems.

SecDev is distinguished by its focus on how to “build security in” (and not simply discover the absence of security). Its goal is to encourage and disseminate ideas for secure system development among both academia and industry. Developers have valuable experiences and ideas that can inform academic research, and researchers have concepts, studies, and even code and tools that could benefit developers. We anticipate that attendees from academic conferences like IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, PLDI, FSE, ISSTA, SOUPS, and many others could contribute ideas to SecDev, as could attendees of industrial conferences like AppSec, RSA, Black Hat, and Shmoocon.

Papers have the option of appearing in the conference’s formal proceedings, or not. SecDev is also interested in tutorials on processes, frameworks, languages, and tools. The goal is to propose useful and thought provoking ideas, and to share knowledge on the art and science of secure system development.

Areas of interest include (but are not limited to):
* Security engineering processes, from requirements to maintenance
* Dynamic/static analysis and runtime approaches towards application security
* Programming languages and frameworks supporting security
* Testing strategies to ensure security
* Explorations of formal verification and other high-assurance methods for security
* Code reviews, red teams, and other human-centered assurance
* Security-focused system (HW/SW/architecture) designs
* Human-centered design for systems security
* Distributed systems design and implementation for security

What makes SecDev different than other conferences?
SecDev is interested in work that has a demonstrated connection to building systems that are more secure. It is not enough to show that an existing system, however prominent, is insecure. Nor is it enough to propose a new cryptosystem or formal security model with nice mathematical properties but no concrete exploration of how it would be used to build systems more securely. Instead, papers should be about (as a few examples) how a development library, tool, or process can produce systems resilient against certain attacks; how a formal foundation could underpin a language, tool, or testing strategy that can help produce stronger systems; and experience, designs, or applications showing how cryptography can be used effectively to secure systems.

A good SecDev paper may resemble an elaborated vision statement, a grant proposal, or a mini-keynote summarizing prior work and directions. We are not interested in complete works that manage to fit in a few pages; rather we want bigger ideas (previously published or not) that will lead to a stimulating, thoughtful, and perhaps (gently) provocative discussion. A good SecDev tutorial will introduce interested practitioners and researchers to technologies (e.g., languages, tools, frameworks) that show promise in aiding the development of secure systems.",,,,,,http://secdev.ieee.org,

MODRNA Discovery,Specification,,"OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery] section 2.1 specifies a way to normalize a user identifier to derive a resource and especially a host for OpenID Provider Issuer Discovery. While this works well for identifiers as email addresses and urls, it does not work for typical identifiers from the mobile network space. In a mobile environment, MSISDN's or ip-addresses are typical resources identifying a user or the respective mobile network operator (MNO). The structure of those identifiers does not allow for an algorithmic normalization. Thus it will be necessary to have a specific service to perform the normalization.

The OpenID Connect Mobile Discovery Profile specifies the interface of this service. Part of the interface specification will be the identification of possible user input identifier types relevant in the Mobile Connect scenario. Remark: Some of those user input identifier types may not identify a single user/device but may be sufficient to identify the right mobile operator. An example for this is the MNC/MCC tuple (mobile network code/ mobile contry code) or the IP address range.

This profile also specifies how a client registers with the MNO discovery service and how Account Chooser service [Account.Chooser] can be used to further improve user experience in the overall Mobile Connect flow.",,,,,,http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2014/04/draft-mobile-discovery-01.html,

• Road pricing systems can and should be designed so that the detailed trip data are fully and permanently deleted from the system after the charges have been settled in order to prevent the creation of movement profiles or the potential for function-creep.
• Processing of personal data for other purposes (e.g. pay-as you drive insurance or be- havioural-based marketing), should only be possible with clear and unambiguous con- sent from the individual.

Web Payments Interest Group,Discussion Group,,"The mission of the Web Payments Interest Group, part of the Web Payments Activity, is to provide a forum for Web Payments technical discussions to identify use cases and requirements for existing and/or new specifications to ease payments on the Web for users (payers) and merchants (payees), and to establish a common ground for payment service providers on the Web Platform. The overall objective of this group is to identify and leverage the conditions for greater uptake and wider use of Web Payments through the identification of standardization needs to increase interoperability between the different stakeholders and the different payment methods.


The Web Payments Interest Group's scope covers payment transactions using Web technologies on all computer devices (desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet, etc.) running a Web user-agent (a Web browser, a hybrid app, or an installed Web application) and using all possible legal payments methods. For instance, this includes:

* Traditional payment methods: e.g.credit and debit cards, credit transfer, direct debit, ACH, e-check, prepaid cards, etc.
* Non-traditional currencies (this term covers multiple cases such as the commonly called cryptocurrencies, digital currencies, or virtual currencies. This category is sometimes designated as ""non-governmental units-of-account"" by some International organizations )
* Newer front-end payment initiating systems (e.g. various flavors of online digital wallets, contactless payments based on various technologies such as NFC or BTLE)
* Other value transfer methods such as loyalty points, coupons, etc.
* New person-to-person payment systems such as Mobile Money in the developing world.

The Web Payments IG will cover a variety of scenarios including Web-mediated Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-Business to Consumer (B2B2C), and Person-to-Person (P2P) transactions in the case of physical (payment at physical shops) and online payments for physical or digital goods, including in-app payments. It will also cover one-time payments as well as e.g. recurring bill payments. Finally it will also cover micro-payments (low value payments) in different cases (P2P in international remittances or B2C/B2B for very small value goods such as press articles).

The tasks that the Interest Group will undertake include:
* Identification of problems, barriers and challenges that currently exists or may appear in the domain of Web Payments. This includes technology aspects as well as business aspects (incentives, etc.) and covers the different stakeholders, in particular customers (more generally payers), merchants (more generally payees), web application developers, and payment system providers. It also includes legal aspects and the IG will have to ensure that the proposed architecture is flexible enough to cope with varieties of regulations that exist across the globe.
* Identification of use-cases and scenarios of payment transactions using Web technologies that need to be addressed. This will cover both online payments, off-line payments and payments at physical shops or face-to-face. Issues such as ""floor-limits"" and ""stand-in"" for specific transaction scenarios should be considered. Different categories of use-cases should be identified to highlight different dimensions such as the role of regulations on technologies, the case of international low-value remittances, general retail payments, bill payments, utility payments etc.
* Identifying ways to improve the usability, security, uptake, and trust of Web payments
* Identification of requirements for more secure and interoperable management of payment transactions on the Web. This includes the identification of areas and places where standards are needed to ensure interoperable interfaces between Web applications and payment systems.
* Identification of the issues related to user privacy protection, user data protection, as well as provision of user data required for regulation or for anti-fraud detection process. This covers also rules, regulations and APIs related to access to accounts.
* Identification of gaps in Web Technologies that do not allow the identified requirements to be met.
* Identification of the role and place of regulations in the overall payment process, and the requirements that regulations impose on technologies to ensure that they are usable all over the world under different regulatory regimes. Different use-cases from different regions of the World should highlight the implication of the different regulations, and the best way to ensure that technologies can be flexible enough to cope with these regulations. Different use-cases and dimensions will be investigated including terms of the payment service between payers, payees and intermediaries, or cross-border payments.
* Priorization of the work items to resolve the identified gaps.
* Review of deliverables under development by other W3C groups that are relevant to the IG scope and report bugs as appropriate.
* Liaison with other organizations in the payment industry that are using Web Technologies for their technical specifications and/or their services to foster alignment and interoperability on a global scale.

Note:
* Development of technical standards is not in scope for the Interest Group. However, this group will encourage the development or adaption of technical standards to bridge the gaps that are identified. This includes the provisions of requirements and liaisons with relevant W3C and external groups and organizations. See the Dependencies and Liaison section.
* The Group will consider the security, privacy and accessibility implications of its use cases and requirements, and seek appropriate review.",,,,,,http://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/,

WITDOM (empoWering prIvacy and securiTy in non-trusteD envirOnMents),Research Project,,"WITDOM (empoWering prIvacy and securiTy in non-trusteD envirOnMents) is an EU Horizon 2020 funded research project with a duration of 36 months, which started in January 2015.

WITDOM focuses on developing innovative solutions for truly efficient and practical privacy enhancing techniques and efficient signal and data processing in the encrypted domain for the increasingly demanded outsourced environments. Actually, the main target WITDOM pursues is to produce a framework for end-to-end protection of data in untrusted and fast evolving ICT-based environments, with a particular focus in data-outsourcing scenarios, where new threats, vulnerabilities and risks due to new uses require end-to-end security solutions that will withstand progress for the lifetime of applications they support.

While currently there are solid bases for homomorphic cryptography and secure processing of data, research in WITDOM will go further, aiming at truly efficient and practical privacy enhancing techniques and efficient signal and data processing in the encrypted domain, and develop a holistic security-by-design framework for quantitative evaluation of end-to-end security and privacy, aiming at guaranteeing efficient and verifiable provision of privacy in the context of ICT services owned by third-party providers of distributed processing and storage, thereby maximizing independence from stated security and privacy commitments by respective providers.

Moreover, research and Innovation in this field cannot ignore the fundamental impact of the EU data protection regulation on the evolution of Cloud-related environments and in the processing of personal and sensitive data.

Finally WITDOM’s innovations deals with the instantiation of the developed framework, platform and tools in two carefully chosen use-case scenarios from the eHealth and Financial services sectors, whose impact and sensitivity of the involved data make privacy a must, and where privacy and confidentiality constraints is a true barrier for profiting from the benefits of outsourced architectures and Cloud-based deployments.",,,,,,http://witdom.eu,

Working Paper on the Use of Deep Packet Inspection for Marketing Purposes,Publication,,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is a technology that automates the inspection1, in real or near-real time, of the header and content portions of data packets being transmitted on networks.
An Internet packet or datagram is generally composed of a ‘datagram header’ and a ‘datagram data area’. The datagram header is the portion of the packet that contains information such as source and destination IP address and other details necessary to get the packet where it needs to go as it trav- erses the network. The datagram data area is referred to as the ‘payload’ because it is the content that the datagram header (the ‘envelope’) generally delivers. The packet header refers to any infor- mation a carrier requires to convey its telecommunications message, and the message itself is re- ferred to as the content or payload of that telecommunications message.
While DPI cannot be considered a new technology, having been used for years in intrusion detection and prevention systems as well as in firewall systems, additional uses – enabled by increased com- puting power and more efficient algorithms – for traffic management, control over the dissemination of illegal or unwanted content – including copyrighted material – and even for delivering targeted advertisements to Internet users have been discussed and started to be introduced more recently.
The application of this technology can put the privacy of Internet users at risk. In particular, certain uses of DPI technologies by Internet access providers can result in severe infringements of privacy of Internet users. Access providers are the “gateway to the virtual world”; they are technically able to monitor the content of the entire communication of an Internet user. It is therefore essential that Internet access providers respect telecommunications secrecy, as laid down in the legal frameworks of many jurisdictions. In addition, Internet access providers in many cases not only offer Internet ac- cess, but also voice telephony services, as well as access to media, such as cable television. Pro- viders of such “triple play”-services can – technically speaking – gain an even more detailed profile of the communications behaviour of their customers. Furthermore, with the advent of new and inno- vative services like telemedicine, more and more personal data of a particularly sensitive nature (such as health data) may be transmitted through facilities offered by Internet access providers.
The Working Group has strong reservations about the application of DPI for any purposes other than maintaining the security of information systems and networks within an organisation2, or as otherwise allowed or required by applicable legislation.",,,,,,https://datenschutz-berlin.de/attachments/726/WP_DPI_07_09_2010_675_41_10__2_.pdf?1292413821,

SDN is a new approach to networking in which network control is decoupled from the data forwarding function and is directly programmable. The result is an extremely dynamic, manageable, cost-effective, and adaptable architecture that gives administrators unprecedented programmability, automation, and control. Implementing SDN via an open standard enables extraordinary agility while reducing service development and operational costs, and frees network administrators to integrate best-of-breed technology as it is developed.

OpenFlow-LogoONF emphasizes an open, collaborative development process that is driven from the end-user perspective. Our signature accomplishment to date is introducing the OpenFlow® Standard, which enables remote programming of the forwarding plane.

Working Paper: Update on Privacy and Security Issues in Internet Telephony (VoIP) and Related Communication Technologies,Publication,,"In September 2006, this Group published a Working Paper on Voice over IP (VoIP) applications1 in an attempt to anticipate possible privacy and security challenges. That paper depicted the situation as seen by the Working Group at the time: it described emerging services, possible future privacy and security risks, and contained a set of privacy- and security-related recommendations to manufacturers of hardware, software developers and VoIP service providers.
In the subsequent 10 years, VoIP has found widespread application by organisations as well as by end users. Furthermore, voice communication has been integrated with a number of other communication technologies, such as instant messaging, text and video. In some regions discussions have already started about phasing out the “Plain Old Telephony System” (POTS), which is now labelled as “legacy infrastructure” by some.
The recommendations in this working paper apply to all types of multi-media services, including instant messaging, real-time text, and video services2. This document furthermore makes no distinction between a VoIP service offered by a telecommunication provider and an over-the-top provider. Even if the technology being used by various companies differs, similar privacy and data protection risks remain and therefore the recommendations apply to all.
In addition to standardised solutions, there are many proprietary products and services available which provide different degrees of security, data protection and privacy. Unfortunately, non-technical users are often uninformed about the protection provided or are not presented with privacy friendly default settings.",,,,,,https://datenschutz-berlin.de/attachments/1237/675.52.10_WP_Update_VoIP_2016.pdf?1470059412,

IDs -- Not That Easy:  Questions About Nationwide Identity Systems,Publication,,"The study is being conducted by the multidisciplinary Committee on Authentication Technologies and Their Privacy Implications, whose mem- bers include experts in the design, implementation, deployment, and use of information systems generally and information systems security in particular, along with experts in privacy law and policy (see Appendix A for committee and staff biographies). Given that identification and au- thentication systems constitute a large portion of the committee’s agenda, it is well positioned to comment on the technology and policy issues surrounding a nationwide identity system and its supporting infrastruc- tures (hereinafter referred to as a nationwide identity system). In fact, CSTB asked the committee to do so, in the interest of providing a timely contribution to the public debate. Additional resources from the Vadasz Family Foundation enabled development of this report.
The committee’s broader and more comprehensive final report is ex- pected in late 2002, but its members felt compelled to issue a brief report at this time because of the real possibility that further debate on a nation- wide identity system, and even action on the topic, could take place prior to the final report’s issuance. Thus the present effort outlines the issues the committee believes must be addressed and raises a number of ques- tions that the committee believes should be answered as part of any con- sideration of a nationwide identity system.",,,,,,http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10346/ids-not-that-easy-questions-about-nationwide-identity-systems,

european Interoperability Framework (EIF) for European Public Services,Publication,,"Purpose and legal framework

The purpose of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) is:
• to promote and support the delivery of European public services by fostering cross-border and cross-sectoral1 interoperability;
• to guide public administrations in their work to provide European public services to businesses2 and citizens;
• to complement and tie together the various National Interoperability Frameworks (NIFs) at European level.

This non-technical document addresses all those involved in defining, designing and implementing European public services.

The EIF should be taken into account when making decisions on European public services that support the implementation of EU policy initiatives. The EIF should also be considered when establishing public services that in the future may be reused as part of European public services.

The EIF is maintained under the ISA3 programme, in close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission. They work together in the spirit of Article 170 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Under this Article, to help achieve the objectives referred to in Article 26 concerning the internal market, the European Union should help establish and develop trans-European networks and promote the interconnection and interoperability of national networks as well as access to such networks.

The EIF contributes to the better functioning of the internal market by increasing interoperability among European public administrations.",,,,,,http://ec.europa.eu/isa/documents/isa_annex_ii_eif_en.pdf,
Working Paper on Privacy and Aerial Surveillance,Publication,,"Surveillance is the monitoring of behavior, activities, or other changing information, for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting someone or something. It often involves observation of individuals or groups by government organizations, although there are some exceptions, such as disease surveillance, which monitors the progress of a dis- ease in a community without directly observing or monitoring individuals.
Aerial surveillance is the gathering of surveillance, usually visual imagery or video, from an airborne vehicle. Since the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Com-
missioners first discussed issues of aerial surveillance by satellites in 19921, there have been far-reaching technological developments. Whereas satellite-based services such as Google Earth at present do not pose particular risks to individual privacy as long as only snapshots with limited resolution of imagery are collected, the situation is different with re- gard to low flying surveillance platforms such as drones. Whereas the use of drones for mili- tary (combat) purposes is the subject of some limited – due to classification - public debate, similar debate about civilian uses of this technology for information collection purposes and their consequences has so far been neglected. The history of satellite technology since 1989 shows however that reconnaissance technology formerly restricted to military use can eventually become available for civilian use as well.",,,,,,https://datenschutz-berlin.de/attachments/996/675.47.25.pdf?1385047665,

Why Identity 3.0?,Publication,,"Principles of Identity 3.0[edit]
The principles[4] behind the assertion of the need for a paradigm shift in digital identity is outlined in a white paper[5] from the Global Identity Foundation, and outlined in a presentation given by Paul Simmonds at an event in London in June 2014.

Risk

Decisions around identity are taken by the entity that is assuming the risk; with full visibility of the identity and attributes of all the entities in the transaction chain.
Attributes of an Identity will be signed by the authoritative source for those attributes.
Identity will work off-line as well as on-line; with a lack of on-line verification simply another factor in the risk equation.
Privacy

Every entity shall need only one identity which is unique and private unto the entity; there will be no body issuing or recording identities.
The Identity ecosystem will be privacy enhancing; attributes will be minimised, asserting only such information that is relevant to the transaction.
Entities will only maintain attributes for which they are the authoritative source.
The identity of one entity to another will be cryptographically unique; negating the need for user-names or passwords and minimising attribute aggregation.
The biometrics (or other authentication method) of an entity will remain within the sole control of the entity; biometric information will not be used, exchanged or stored outside of the entities sole control.
Functionality

The digital representation and function of an entity type will be indistinguishable from another entity type, and will be interchangeable in operation.
The Identity ecosystem will operate without the need for identity brokers, CA of last resort or other centralised infrastructure.
Identity will be simply expandable to encompass the security of data; E-mail (for example) can be encrypted simply by having an entities e-mail attributes shared with them.
Identity shall be (as much as possible) invisible to the end user; identity and attribute verification and exchange should be a background operation until such time that increased levels of user verification is required.
Everyone plays their part – no more!",,,,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_3.0
