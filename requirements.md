# Requirements

1. _The wiki will be freely available to the global public._

  A public github repository is publicly available, and can be
  copied to any git provider.  The wiki exists in a git repository
  hosted on github which enables the use of github specific
  features including
  - as github pages (free hosting)
  - issue tracking
  - an operations-oriented wiki (e.g. a wiki about the wiki)

  Editing of the **official** wiki will require `write access`
  to the repository, which is enabled via a free github account
  and requesting write access from a repository owner.  This is
  the standard model used by almost all open-source projects, and
  has many well established variations.  This is similar also
  to Wikipedia - which is **not** editable by the general public,
  but only by users who have registered with Wikipedia and who
  have been granted write access.

  It is worth noting that anyone can make their own copy of the
  wiki, host it anywhere, and edit to their own delight **without**
  registering with github - the restriction of having a github
  account is only in place for two reasons
  - be able to track **who** made what changes
  - provide a barrier to **spam** and **bot** edits

2. _The wiki will not be associated with the Me2B Alliance website--it will be made available as a freestanding public resource. (Me2B will provide the domain.)_

  This is well supported by github pages.
3. _Wiki must have admin/content editor capabilities._

  This is achieved using standard open-source access patterns,
  where the owner of a repository has ultimate control and where
  other participants have different levels of control as specified by
  the owner.  Because of the public nature of a the repository, anyone 
  can make a copy and become the owner of their own instance of the
  repository - but the **official** copy, which is bound to the domain
  in #2 above, always has a point of primary control.

4. _The wiki must have an intuitive graph-based UI._

  The wiki supports the TiddlyMap editor, which is a common
  graph editor - however, it is not clear if it is **intuitive**,
  as that depends heavily on the background skills and expectations
  of the user.  What is **intuitive** to one person can be opaque
  and cumbersome to another and often changes over time for a
  given user.

5. _The full ontology of the wiki needs to be created, but minimally needs to include the fields that are included here:  https://zdrive.li/LnH_

6. _The categories of Trustable Technology enabler organizations are currently defined as follows but these should be vetted and validated in developing the final ontology:_

  - Movements (Education, PR, Awareness)
  - Standards Bodies & Open Source
  - Implementations
  - Consumer  Organizations
  - Trade Organizations / Supplier Support
  - Certifications
  - Policy & Regulatory
  - Thinktanks
  - Academic & Research

7. _The Me2B Alliance will use the wiki to easily identify what products and services are being provided by catalyst and support organizations working on privacy related initiatives._

8. _The Me2B Alliance will use the wiki to identify interdependencies between Me2B and external organizations:_
    - _what Me2B Alliance gives to and what it receives from a particular organization._
    - _Ideally, the interdependencies can be linked to project planning tools (Jira, Asana, tbd) in order to reflect actual timing and progress (nice to have)._

9. _Anyone can use the Wiki to understand what organizations are working on particular aspects of promoting digital privacy, dignity and empowerment._

10. _Anyone can edit wiki entries.  Should we consider some kind of registration?_

  This is dealt with in #1 above, and care must be taken to be
  very clear on what is meant by anyone.  Wikipedia, for example,
  is **not** editable by anyone - it is **only** editable by
  registered users.  **Anyone** means that any random **bot** or
  **agent** or **script** or **person** could make any change at
  any time, with no restriction whatsoever.  This is not advisable
  for any asset on the internet.

  Restricting write access to **registered** or **authorized** users, likewise, does not mean that there is a strict, centrally
  controlled hierarchy.  100% of the open-source initiatives in
  the world use this model.  The degree of open-ness of a project
  is determined by the

11. _The proposal should include the initial population of the wiki based on the Me2B Alliance link above and any other relevant sources._
12. _The proposal may include support for a content moderator._
13. _The proposal should include some nominal ongoing maintenance._

14. _The wiki software platform should be existing commercially available technology (i.e. tried and true)._

    GitHub powers the
